Versioning
==========

The version scheme for this thesis will roughly follow the [semantic versioning][semver] idea,
although strictly speaking not the scheme.

- Versioning will have the scheme MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- Versioning will start at 0.1.0 and always increment
- The version submitted to the examiners will be 1.0.0
- Changes requested by the examiners will increment the version past 1.0.0
    - The MINOR versions will be incremented for significant changes, e.g. replotting figures,
        rewriting paragraphs, adding sections to the thesis.
    - The PATCH versions will be incremented for small bug
        fixes, e.g. adding references, typos, rewriting sentences.
- The MINOR version number is not limited to a
    single digit, i.e. the MINOR version after 0.9.0 is 0.10.0.
- Prior to the release of 1.0.0 the thesis is considered in DRAFT format
    - Significant progress to the thesis document will increment the MINOR
        version number. What constitutes significant progress is entirely up to the author, however
        examples might be the completion of a new chapter draft, the finalisation of a chapter,
        replacing all the figures for consistency or any other similarly large change.
    - Smaller progress will increment the PATCH version number. Again the
        incrementing of this number is entirely up to the author. Examples of this might be a revision
        of a chapter, formatting changes, or simply celebrating the volume of work performed.
    - All incrementing of version numbers MUST be celebrated.
- The suffixes -dev, or -pre followed by a number can be added to a version number
    for the release of a version for checking prior to a release. A good example of
    this will be preparing for a 1.0.0 release and printing a version for checking.
