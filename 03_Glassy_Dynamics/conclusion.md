# Conclusion

In @sec:jump_dynamics we find the onset of jump dynamics
to explain the presence of dynamic heterogeneities.
As the temperature drops,
the length scale of re-organising the local environment increases,
resulting in large jumps between configurations.
For these large jumps to be described by Brownian dynamics
many of them need to be observed.
The distribution of these jumps is much wider than for Brownian dynamics,
with particle motion dominated by
relaxations which have a long timescale but low probability.
When averaging over many relaxation times as in @fig:jump_heterogeneties,
the distribution returns to a Gaussian.
The increasing length scale of the jumps
is likely related to the increasing length scale
of dynamic heterogeneities described by
the free energy model of dynamics.

@sec:sed explains the breakdown of the Stokes--Einstein--Debye relations.
This describes two types of dynamics,
the short timescale jump dynamics
where the assumption of Brownian dynamics no longer holds.
Motions over the length scale of the structural and rotational relaxations
are highly correlated as they tend to occur in a single jump.
Over larger length and time scales,
like those associated with translational diffusion,
the dynamics returns to Brownian in nature.
This dual nature of the dynamics
describes the problems replicating the decoupling
of translational and rotational motion in simulations.
This is further explained in @sec:trans_rot_coupling
where rather than the different temperature dependences
describing a decoupling of translations and rotations,
when looking at the motions of individual molecules
there is actually a coupling of motions.
