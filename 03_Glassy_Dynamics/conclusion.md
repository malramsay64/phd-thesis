# Conclusion

In @sec:molecular_relaxation we have developed a collection of
methods which allow for the calculation of
many dynamics quantities on a single molecule basis.
Using the Trimer model we have established
these tools give results which are comparable
to the dynamics quantities which describe
experimentally observable results.

Using these new methods of analysing dynamics,
@sec:sed explains the breakdown of the Stokes--Einstein--Debye relations.
This describes two types of dynamics,
the short timescale jump dynamics
where the assumption of Brownian dynamics no longer holds.
Motions over the length scale of the structural and rotational relaxations
are highly correlated as they tend to occur in a single jump.
Over larger length and time scales,
like those associated with translational diffusion,
the dynamics returns to Brownian in nature.
This dual nature of the dynamics
describes the problems replicating the decoupling
of translational and rotational motion in simulations.
This is further explained in @sec:trans_rot_coupling
where rather than the different temperature dependences
describing a decoupling of translations and rotations,
when looking at the motions of individual molecules
there is actually a coupling of motions.
