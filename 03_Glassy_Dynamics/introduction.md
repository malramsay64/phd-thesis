# Introduction

## Breakdown in Stokes--Einstein--Debye

The Stokes--Einstein--Debye (SED) theory of dynamics
describes a series of relations (@eq:sed_proportionality) between dynamics quantities.
These relations describe the dynamics of a wide range of liquids,
however, they start to break down in fragile liquids
close to the glass transition temperature.
The canonical example of this is the decoupling
of rotational and translational diffusion [@Chang1994;@Griffin2012;@Fujara1992]
shown in @fig:trans_rot_otp.
This decoupling results from a change in the viscosity dependence
of the translational diffusion having the relationship $D_t \propto \eta^{-0.75}$
which has deviated from the expected $D_t \propto \eta-1$. [@Chang1994]

There is a general consensus on the presence of both these
decoupling within experimental studies, [@Chang1994;@Griffin2012;@Fujara1992]
however, there has been difficulty replicating these results in simulations
demonstrated within this thesis in @sec:trans_rot_decoupling.
@Shi2013 find a similar relationship to those of experiments
for the decoupling of translational diffusion and viscosity,
a result mirrored by @Sengupta2013.
Neither of these studies looked at the rotational motions of particles.
Recent simulations by @Kawasaki2019 on supercooled water
find both a decoupling between translational diffusion and viscosity,
and a decoupling of translational and rotational diffusion,
however, there is also a decoupling of
the rotational diffusion and viscosity that is not observed in experiment
and the rotational diffusion is slow compared to translational diffusion,
the opposite of the experimental results.
This same flipping of the rotational and translational diffusion
is also observed by @Lombardo2006.

The typical simulation quantities used for establishing
the breakdown in the SED relations
are the translational diffusion constant $D_t$
and the rotational relaxation time $\tau_r$.
When there are dynamic heterogeneities present,
these two quantities capture different elements
of the distribution,
with the translational diffusion capturing the fastest particles,
while the rotational relaxation is dominated by the slowest particles.
Consider two regions of dynamics,
one containing fast particles with $\tau_\text{fast}$ and $D_\text{fast}$
and the other containing slow particles with $\tau_\text{slow}$ and $D_\text{slow}$,
where $\tau$ is a relaxation time and $D$ is a diffusion constant.
These values are such that $\tau_{fast} << \tau_{slow}$ and
$D_\text{fast} >> D_\text{slow}$.
When finding the average relaxation time

$$ \frac{\tau_\text{fast} + \tau_\text{slow}}{2} \approx \frac{\tau_\text{slow}}{2} $$

and the average diffusion constant

$$ \frac{D_\text{fast} + D_\text{slow}}{2} \approx \frac{D_\text{fast}}{2} $$

we can see how these relaxations behave differently.
Here the presence of dynamic heterogeneities results in
a decoupling of translational and rotational motion
by the choice of parameters.

### Breakdown in rotational coupling

A limitation of the Stokes--Einstein model,
acknowledged by Einstein as such, [@Einstein1907;@Bian2016]
is that the inertia of a particle is neglected.
This means that the time resolution of observations becomes important
for the motions of particles. [@Pusey2011;@Li2013]
The SED relations are based on Brownian dynamics
however there is evidence of rotational motions
not described by Brownian motion,
coming in the form of jump dynamics. [@Das2015;@Nair2019;@Laage2006;@Andreozzi1996;@Jose2006]
When describing rotation dynamics using spherical harmonics
known as the Debye formalism, [@Lombardo2006]
there are multiple choices for the order of the Legendre polynomial $l$.
@Eq:debye_rotational_diffusion describes the relationship
between the relaxation times for difference choices of $l$.
The ratio $\tau_1/\tau_2$ is used to measure contribution
of large angular jumps to rotational relaxation. [@Jose2006;@Kivelson1970]
The Debye model predicts an exponential decay of the $l$th rank
single-particle orientation time correlation function $R_l^s$,

$$ R_l^s = \exp\left(\frac{-t}{\tau_l}\right) $$

which gives the corresponding relaxation time

$$ \tau_l = \frac{1}{l(l+1)D_r}, $$

where $D_r$ is the rotational diffusion coefficient.
Comparing this relationship for
the first and second-order relaxation functions

$$ \tau_1/\tau_2 = \frac{2(2 + 1) D_r}{1(1+1) D_r} = 3$$

When molecules rotate inertially, that is,
there are large angular displacements between collisions.
The relaxation is no longer exponential,
and can be identified by the ratio $\tau_1/\tau_2$
falling within the range

$$ 1 < \tau_1/\tau_2 < 3 $$

The value of 3 (or 4 for 2D systems)
indicates the rotations are governed by Brownian dynamics,
that is, rotations take place through a sequence of small random steps.
When there are large changes in orientation,
the two relaxation times become correlated
as there are fewer steps for relaxation to occur.
At the limit, a single large motion can describe
both relaxation quantities simultaneously
which is described the $\tau_1/\tau_2 = 1$

The presence of jump dynamics describes a process
by which the rotational motion deviates
from that of the SED relations,
however it doesn't explain why the rotational motion is slower.
One possible explanation for this is to
consider the molecular structure as a network of gears, [@Zwanzig1987]
where contacting molecules transfer angular momentum.
As a network of gears,
there is the requirement that the angular momentum of neighbouring molecules
is equal and opposite.
When there are many gears in a plane,
this requirement for rotation in opposite directions
can lead to the jamming of rotational motion.
Take for example @fig:gears_triple,
adding the third gear in a triangular lattice
now means that none of the gears can turn,
completely preventing rotational motion.
In modelling a random network of gears,
similar to that which would be found in a liquid,
@Zwanzig1987 found that the networks resulted in
a very slow decay or rotational relaxation
dominated by large clusters relaxing slowly.

If we model the rotational motion of a gear network
Where there are three gears,
like in a triangular lattice
the rotational motion is jammed,
while four gears allow motion to propagate.

## Dynamic Heterogeneities and structure

The presence of dynamic heterogeneities
is a significant feature as a liquid approaches
the glass transition temperature,
yet despite being one of the most extensively studied problems
in condensed matter physics [@Debenedetti1997;@Berthier2011;@Karmakar2014]
it is still poorly understood.
There are many theoretical foundations
for understanding dynamic heterogeneities,
with one of the more general frameworks introduced by @Goldstein1969
represents each configuration as a point
on a high dimensional potential energy landscape.
This idea is depicted in @fig:potential_energy_landscape,
showing an example two dimensional representation.
In a high temperature liquid,
a configuration is free to move around the potential energy surface
with the energy being larger than any of the barriers between configurations,
giving rise to homogeneous dynamics,
where particles are free to diffuse.
At temperatures close to the glass transition,
the size of the energy barriers between configurations
is comparable to the energy of the liquid
changing the types of motions which take place.
In this low energy state,
the kinetically favourable transition states are too high in energy,
instead motion occurs through transition states
which involve the cooperative motion of many particles.
This low energy state results in diffusion
becoming an activated process,
requiring concentrations of energy to occur.
There has been evidence of the transition from
free to activated diffusion in simulations of atomic systems [@Barrat1991;@Wahnstrom1991]
where the motions change from many small random motions at high temperatures
to a large motions from one site to another at low temperatures,
often involved correlated motions of particles.

An important part of the potential energy landscape model
is that the structure plays a role in the dynamics,
defining the types of transitions which take place.
In a simulation study initialising the same structural configuration
with a range of randomised momenta,
@Widmer-Cooper2004 found the dynamic heterogeneities
present in all regions of the structure,
regardless of initial momenta.

## Goals for understanding dynamics

In @sec:molecular_relaxation we introduce new relaxation quantities
to describe the relaxations of individual molecules.
These molecular relaxation quantities allow more insight
into the dynamic heterogeneities present in supercooled liquids.
In @sec:sed we use these new molecular relaxations
to describe the relationship between
jump dynamics and dynamic heterogeneities,
and exampling the coupling between
rotational and translational motions
and the impact these have on
the Stokes--Einstein--Debye model of dynamics.
