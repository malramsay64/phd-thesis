# Results

To allow the comparison of dynamics between materials with a range of properties,
dynamics quantities are presented relative to the melting point of the material,
that is using the quantity

$$ T/T_m $$

where $T$ is the experimental temperature and $T_m$ is the melting point.
For the results presented here,
we don't have an accurate determination of the melting point,
instead using our best approximation,
the details of which are discussed in \ref{sec:crystal_melting}

## Comparison with other systems

- The behaviour of the dynamics is not too unusual
- Comparison to existing results and to 3D simulations

### MSD

### Structural relaxation

### Rotational Relaxation
