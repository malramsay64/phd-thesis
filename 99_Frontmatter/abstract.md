title: Abstract
---

Despite extensive study of molecular materials,
their dynamic behaviour as fragile liquids
and their phenomenally slow crystal growth rates,
are both observations we don't fully understand.
This thesis introduces a 2D molecular liquid based on ortho-terphenyl,
that is used to investigate the behaviour of the liquid state
through molecular dynamics simulations.
Using newly developed methods for describing
the dynamic behaviour of individual molecules,
we show dynamic heterogeneities result from the onset jump dynamics,
where motion occurs through large reorganisations.
We also find these properties of fragile liquids
are not related to the melting point as they are normally described,
instead by the onset of the glass transition.
With an understanding of the impact of length scales in describing dynamics,
we can attribute the observed decoupling of rotational and translational diffusion
to the coupling of rotations and translations within each molecule.
In our study of crystal growth,
we find the rigid structure of the molecular liquid and crystal
inhibits the transition from a crystalline to liquid-like state,
drastically slowing the melting of the crystal phase.
These transitions are made even slower by the suppression
of rotational motion at the interface of the crystal.
The results found in this thesis with a 2D molecule
provide the basis for investigations in 3D simulations
and experimental systems.
