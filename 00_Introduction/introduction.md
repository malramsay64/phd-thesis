# Introduction

- There are many aspects of molecular liquids which are not understood
    - growth rates
    - fragile liquid

- Molecular liquids are challenging
    - Rotational motion
    - more degrees of freedom
    - chemical interactions
    - crystal polymorphs

- Ortho-terphenyl is a widely studied molecule for both growth rates and being a fragile
  liquid
    - Many models of various degrees of approximation
    - Simplest is Lewis--Wahnstr√∂m
    - Simulations still run into issues, periodic boundary effects, timescales

- The idea of taking a computationally simple system that is easy to visualise and
  applying the ideas to 3D has been done in many cases
    - dynamic heterogeneities
    - packing of Trimers
    - binary Lennard Jones discs

- Here we introduce the Trimer
    - molecule definition

## Project Outline

- Demonstrate the trimer molecule is an appropriate model for the dynamic behaviours of
  ortho-terphenyl and other fragile liquids.
- Use the trimer to introduce new dynamics quantities which allow for a better
  understanding of the dynamics at the molecular level. This is done by describing the
  origin of the breakdown of the Stokes--Einstein--Debye relations.
- Introduce a new method for the identification of crystal polymorphs and the liquid
  state. This will be required to observe the slow growth rate of this molecule.
- Characterise the melting rate of the Trimer molecule, comparing it to different
  theories.
- Investigate the slow melting rates of the trimer.
