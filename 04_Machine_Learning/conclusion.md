# Conclusion

Machine learning is a valuable tool
for the understanding of crystal structures in molecular dynamics simulations.
This is shown using clustering in @sec:clustering
to find local structures which are highly stable,
that is highly occupied.
The identification of these structures within additional configurations
can then be done using supervised learning,
shown in @sec:supervised_learning.
However most important to machine learning
is the understanding of the data being used,
whether that is finding a description of the local structure
which best describes the differences
between the states of interest.
This allows for simpler models
which are both faster to compute
but also more understandable and describable.
