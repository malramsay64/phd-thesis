  abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) methods compute the trajectory of a system of point particles in response to a potential function by numerically integrating Newtonʼs equations of motion. Extending these basic methods with rigid body constraints enables composite particles with complex shapes such as anisotropic nanoparticles, grains, molecules, and rigid proteins to be modeled. Rigid body constraints are added to the GPU-accelerated MD package, HOOMD-blue, version 0.10.0. The software can now simulate systems of particles, rigid bodies, or mixed systems in microcanonical (NVE), canonical (NVT), and isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensembles. It can also apply the FIRE energy minimization technique to these systems. In this paper, we detail the massively parallel scheme that implements these algorithms and discuss how our design is tuned for the maximum possible performance. Two different case studies are included to demonstrate the performance attained, patchy spheres and tethered nanorods. In typical cases, HOOMD-blue on a single GTX 480 executes 2.5–3.6 times faster than LAMMPS executing the same simulation on any number of CPU cores in parallel. Simulations with rigid bodies may now be run with larger systems and for longer time scales on a single workstation than was previously even possible on large clusters.},

  abstract = {Modern graphics processing units (GPUs) provide impressive computing resources, which can be accessed conveniently through the CUDA programming interface. We describe how GPUs can be used to considerably speed up molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for system sizes ranging up to about 1 million particles. Particular emphasis is put on the numerical long-time stability in terms of energy and momentum conservation, and caveats on limited floating-point precision are issued. Strict energy conservation over 108 MD steps is obtained by double-single emulation of the floating-point arithmetic in accuracy-critical parts of the algorithm. For the slow dynamics of a supercooled binary Lennard-Jones mixture, we demonstrate that the use of single-floating point precision may result in quantitatively and even physically wrong results. For simulations of a Lennard-Jones fluid, the described implementation shows speedup factors of up to 80 compared to a serial implementation for the CPU, and a single CPU was found to compare with a parallelised MD simulation using 64 distributed cores.

We discuss the algorithms that are used to exploit the processing power of the GPUs and show the performance that can be achieved in comparison to simulations on conventional CPU clusters. The implementation supports three different precision models in which the contributions to the forces are calculated in single precision floating point arithmetic but accumulated in double precision (SPDP), or everything is computed in single precision (SPSP) or double precision (DPDP). In addition to performance, we have focused on understanding the implications of the different precision models on the outcome of implicit solvent MD simulations. We show results for a range of tests including the accuracy of single point force evaluations and energy conservation as well as structural properties pertainining to protein dynamics. The numerical noise due to rounding errors within the SPSP precision model is sufficiently large to lead to an accumulation of errors which can result in unphysical trajectories for long time scale simulations. We recommend the use of the mixed-precision SPDP model since the numerical results obtained are comparable with those of the full double precision DPDP model and the reference double precision CPU implementation but at significantly reduced computational cost. Our implementation provides performance for GB simulations on a single desktop that is on par with, and in some cases exceeds, that of traditional supercomputers.},

  abstract = {Glasses are disordered materials that lack the periodicity of crystals but behave mechanically like solids. The most common way of making a glass is by cooling a viscous liquid fast enough to avoid crystallization. Although this route to the vitreous state-supercooling-has been known for millennia, the molecular processes by which liquids acquire amorphous rigidity upon cooling are not fully understood. Here we discuss current theoretical knowledge of the manner in which intermolecular forces give rise to complex behaviour in supercooled liquids and glasses. An intriguing aspect of this behaviour is the apparent connection between dynamics and thermodynamics. The multidimensional potential energy surface as a function of particle coordinates (the energy landscape) offers a convenient viewpoint for the analysis and interpretation of supercooling and glass-formation phenomena. That much of this analysis is at present largely qualitative reflects the fact that precise computations of how viscous liquids sample their landscape have become possible only recently.},

We show that spatial correlations exist among particles undergoing extremely large ("mobile") or extremely small ("immobile") displacements over a suitably chosen time interval. The immobile particles form the cores of relatively compact clusters, while the mobile particles move cooperatively and form quasi-one-dimensional, stringlike clusters. The strength and length scale of the correlations between mobile particles are found to grow strongly with decreasing temperature, and the mean cluster size appears to diverge near the mode-coupling critical temperature. We show that these correlations in the particle displacements are related to equilibrium fluctuations in the local potential energy and local composition.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to study the structure and dynamical heterogeneity in the liquid and glass states of Al using a frequently employed embedded atom potential. While the pair correlation function of the glass and liquid states displays only minor differences, the icosahedral short-range order (ISRO) and the dynamics of the two states are very different. The ISRO is much stronger in the glass than in the liquid. It is also found that both the most mobile and the most immobile atoms in the glass state tend to form clusters, and the clusters formed by the immobile atoms are more compact. In order to investigate the local environment of each atom in the liquid and glass states, a local density is defined to characterize the local atomic packing. There is a strong correlation between the local packing density and the mobility of the atoms. These results indicate that dynamical heterogeneity in glasses is directly correlated to the local structure. We also analyze the diffusion mechanisms of atoms in the liquid and glass states. It is found that for the mobile atoms in the glass state, initially they are confined in the cages formed by their nearest neighbors and vibrating. On the time scale of β relaxation, the mobile atoms try to break up the cage confinement and hop into new cages. In the supercooled liquid states, however, atoms continuously diffuse. Furthermore, it is found that on the time scale of β relaxation, some of the mobile atoms in the glass state cooperatively hop, which is facilitated by the stringlike cluster structures. On the longer time scale, it is found that a certain fraction of atoms can simultaneously hop, although they are not nearest neighbors. Further analysis shows that these hopping atoms form big and more compact clusters than the characterized most mobile atoms. The cooperative rearrangement of these big compact clusters might facilitate the simultaneous hopping of atoms in the glass states on the long time scale.},

  abstract = {When we lower the temperature of a liquid, at some point we meet a first order phase transition to the crystal. Yet, under certain conditions it is possible to keep the system in its metastable phase and to avoid crystallization. In this way the liquid enters in the supercooled phase. Supercooled liquids have a very rich phenomenology, which is still far from being completely understood. To begin with, there is the problem of how to prevent crystallization and how deeply the liquid can be supercooled before a metastability limit is hit. But by far the most interesting feature of supercooled liquids is the dynamic glass transition: when the temperature is decreased below a certain point, the relaxation time increases so much that a dramatic dynamical arrest intervenes and we are unable to equilibrate the system within reasonable experimental times. The glass transition is a phenomenon whose physical origin has stirred an enormous interest in the last hundred years. Why does it occur? Is it just a conventional reference point, or does it have a more profound physical meaning? Is it a purely dynamical event, or the manifestation of a true thermodynamic transition? What is the correlation length associated to the sharp increase of the relaxation time? Can we define a new kind of amorphous order? A shared theory of supercooled liquids and the glass transition does not yet exist and these questions are still largely open. Here, I will illustrate in the most elementary fashion the main phenomenological traits of supercooled liquids and discuss in a very partial way a few theoretical ideas on the subject. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We start with a broad introduction to the field and emphasize its connections with other subjects and its relevance. The important role played by computer simulations in studying and understanding the dynamics of systems close to the glass transition at the molecular level is given. The recent progress on the subject of the spatially heterogeneous dynamics that characterizes structural relaxation in materials with slow dynamics is reviewed. The main theoretical approaches are presented describing the glass transition in supercooled liquids, focusing on theories that have a microscopic, statistical mechanics basis. We describe both successes and failures and critically assess the current status of each of these approaches. The physics of aging dynamics in disordered materials and the rheology of soft glassy materials are then discussed, and recent theoretical progress is described. For each section, an extensive overview is given of the most recent advances, but we also describe in some detail the important open problems that will occupy a central place in this field in the coming years.

The greater the fragility (i.e., deviation away from an Arrhenius temperature dependence for eta), the larger the difference 1-xi. We argue that this breakdown in scaling between the crystal growth kinetics and the viscosity is a manifestation of heterogeneous dynamics in supercooled liquids. In addition, we show that the absolute growth rate at intermediate viscosities is correlated with the entropy difference between the liquid and the crystal.},

  abstract = {The transition of a fluid to a rigid glass upon cooling is a common route of transformation from liquid to solid that embodies the most poorly understood features of both phases1,2,3. From the liquid perspective, the puzzle is to understand stress relaxation in the disordered state. From the perspective of solids, the challenge is to extend our description of structure and its mechanical consequences to materials without long range order. Using computer simulations, we show that the localized low frequency normal modes of a configuration in a supercooled liquid are causally correlated to the irreversible structural reorganization of the particles within that configuration. We also demonstrate that the spatial distribution of these soft local modes can persist in spite of significant particle reorganization. The consequence of these two results is that it is now feasible to construct a theory of relaxation length scales in glass-forming liquids without recourse to dynamics and to explicitly relate molecular properties to their collective relaxation.},

We demonstrate that the densest packed crystal exhibits a maximum in the number of contacts per particle but does not necessarily include particle pairs with the maximum contact number. In contrast, amorphous structures, generated by energy minimisation of high temperature liquids, typically do include maximum contact pairs. The amorphous structures exhibit a large number of contacts per particle corresponding to over-constrained structures. Possible consequences of this over-constraint are discussed.},

So far, the established empirical correlations of GFA (ref. ) are statistical guides at best and lack a microscopic rationale. Although simulations have the potential to provide this physical insight into the maximum crystallization rate, crystal nucleation is often too slow to be observed. In contrast, measuring the growth rate of a planar crystal surface represents an accessible route to understanding ordering kinetics. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to show that the crystal growth rate for an important binary glass former, CuZr, is significantly slower than that of a poor glass former, NiAl. In accounting for this difference, we find that the crystal/liquid interface in NiAl exhibits a significantly greater width than that of CuZr. Our results suggest that the crystal/liquid interfacial structure exerts an important influence on the GFA of alloys.},

As a liquid is cooled far below its melting point, dynamics in some regions of the sample can be orders of magnitude faster than dy- namics in other regions only a few nanometers away. In this review, the experimental work that characterizes this heterogeneity is described. In particular, the following questions are addressed: How large are the heterogeneities? How long do they last? How much do dynamics vary between the fastest and slowest regions? Why do these heterogeneities arise? The answers to these questions influence practical applications of glass-forming materials, including polymers, metallic glasses, and pharmaceuti- cals.},

By determining the temperature dependence of the interface velocity, an accurate estimate of the melting temperature is provided. The value k=0.0025 m/s/K for the kinetic growth coefficient is found. This value is about two orders of magnitude smaller than that found in recent simulation studies of one-component metals. The classical Wilson-Frenkel model is not able to describe the crystal growth kinetics on a quantitative level.

Currently various empirical, graphical, and numerical iterative methods are in use. Derivation of the solution is simplified by use of unit quaternions to represent rotation. I emphasize a symmetry property that a solution to this problem ought to possess. The best translational offset is the difference between the centroid of the coordinates in one system and the rotated and scaled centroid of the coordinates in the other system. The best scale is equal to the ratio of the root-mean-square deviations of the coordinates in the two systems from their respective centroids. These exact results are to be preferred to approximate methods based on measurements of a few selected points. The unit quaternion representing the best rotation is the eigenvector associated with the most positive eigenvalue of a symmetric 4 × 4 matrix. The elements of this matrix are combinations of sums of products of corresponding coordinates of the points.},

We train a machine learning (ML) model on previously reported observations, parameters from physiochemical theories, and make it synthesis method–dependent to guide high-throughput (HiTp) experiments to find a new system of metallic glasses in the Co-V-Zr ternary. Experimental observations are in good agreement with the predictions of the model, but there are quantitative discrepancies in the precise compositions predicted. We use these discrepancies to retrain the ML model. The refined model has significantly improved accuracy not only for the Co-V-Zr system but also across all other available validation data. We then use the refined model to guide the discovery of metallic glasses in two additional previously unreported ternaries. Although our approach of iterative use of ML and HiTp experiments has guided us to rapid discovery of three new glass-forming systems, it has also provided us with a quantitatively accurate, synthesis method–sensitive predictor for metallic glasses that improves performance with use and thus promises to greatly accelerate discovery of many new metallic glasses. We believe that this discovery paradigm is applicable to a wider range of materials and should prove equally powerful for other materials and properties that are synthesis path–dependent and that current physiochemical theories find challenging to predict.},

  abstract = {High-throughput density-functional calculations of solids are extremely time consuming. As an alternative, we here propose a machine learning approach for the fast prediction of solid-state prop-erties. To achieve this, LSDA calculations are used as training set. We focus on predicting metallic vs. insulating behavior, and on predicting the value of the density of electronic states at the Fermi energy. We find that conventional representations of the input data, such as the Coulomb matrix, are not suitable for the training of learning machines in the case of periodic solids. We propose a novel crystal structure representation for which learning and competitive prediction accuracies become possible within an unrestricted class of spd systems. Due to magnetic phenomena learning on d systems is found more difficult than in pure sp systems. In recent years ab-initio high-throughput computa-tional methods (HTM) have proven to be a powerful and successful tool to predict new materials and to optimize desired materials properties. Phase diagrams of multi-component crystals [1–3] and alloys [4] have been suc-cessfully predicted. High-impact technological applica-tions have been achieved by improving the performance of Lithium based batteries [5–7], by tailoring the non-linear optical response in organic molecules [8] for optical signal processing, by designing desired current-voltage characteristics [9] for photovoltaic materials, by optimiz-ing the electrode transparency and conductivity [10] for solar cell technology, and by screening metals for the highest amalgamation enthalpy [11] to efficiently remove Hg pollutants in coal gasification. However, the computational cost of electronic struc-ture calculations poses a serious bottleneck for HTM. Thinking of quaternary, quinternary, etc., compounds, the space of possible materials becomes so large, and the complexity of the unit cells so high that, even within ef-ficient Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT), a systematic high-throughput exploration grows beyond reach for present-day computing facilities. As a way out, one would like to have a more direct way to access the physical property of interest without actually solving the KS-DFT equations. Machine learning (ML) techniques offer an attractive possibility of this type. ML-based cal-culations are very fast, typically requiring only fractions of a second to predict a specific property of a given ma-terial, after having trained the ML model on a represen-tative training set of materials. ML methods rely on two main ingredients, the learn-ing algorithm itself and the representation of the input data. There are many different ways of representing a given material or compound. While, from the physicists point of view, the information is simply given by the charges and the positions of the nuclei, for ML algorithms},

Of the many methods used for this description, quaternionic formalisms offer unique advantages. Quaternions are defined and used to introduce Rodrigues quaternions, whose elements in a rotation angle–axis \textbackslash\{\textbackslash{}Phi,\textbackslash{}hat\{\textbackslash{}bf\{n\}\}\textbackslash\} parameterization are defined by the Euler–Rodrigues (ER) parameters \textbackslash\{\textbackslash{}cos\textbackslash{}Phi/2,\textbackslash{}hat\{\textbackslash{}bf\{n\}\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}sin\textbackslash{}Phi/2\textbackslash\}. The utility of Rodrigues quaternions for handling the calculus of rotations via a simple composition rule is emphasized. The traditional use of SO(3) and SU(2) matrix representations of the rotation group in a classical description of NMR is discussed, noting in particular the isomorphism between SU(2) and the group of Rodrigues quaternions. It is this isomorphism that underlies the equivalent utility of the Cayley–Klein parameters or the ER parameters in the classical description of rotations. The rotation angle–axis \textbackslash\{\textbackslash{}Phi,\textbackslash{}hat\{\textbackslash{}bf\{n\}\}\textbackslash\} and the Euler angle \{α, β, γ\} parameterizations of rotations are compared by deriving and solving the corresponding kinematic relations for the ER parameters and the Euler angles \{α, β, γ\}.

  abstract = {Glasses can be formed by many routes. In some cases, distinct polyamorphic forms are found. The normal mode of glass formation is cooling of a viscous liquid. Liquid behavior during cooling is classified between "strong" and "fragile," and the three canonical characteristics of relaxing liquids are correlated through the fragility. Strong liquids become fragile liquids on compression. In some cases, such conversions occur during cooling by a weak first-order transition. This behavior can be related to the polymorphism in a glass state through a recent simple modification of the van der Waals model for tetrahedrally bonded liquids. The sudden loss of some liquid degrees of freedom through such first-order transitions is suggestive of the polyamorphic transition between native and denatured hydrated proteins, which can be interpreted as single-chain glass-forming polymers plasticized by water and cross-linked by hydrogen bonds. The onset of a sharp change in d{$<$}r2{$>$}dT({$<$}r2{$>$} is the Debye-Waller factor and T is temperature) in proteins, which is controversially indentified with the glass transition in liquids, is shown to be general for glass formers and observable in computer simulations of strong and fragile ionic liquids, where it proves to be close to the experimental glass transition temperature. The latter may originate in strong anharmonicity in modes ("bosons"), which permits the system to access multiple minima of its configuration space. These modes, the Kauzmann temperature TK, and the fragility of the liquid, may thus be connected.},

  abstract = {This key-issues review is a plea for a new focus on simpler and more realistic models of glass-forming fluids. It seems to me that we have too often been led astray by sophisticated mathematical models that beautifully capture some of the most intriguing features of glassy behavior, but are too unrealistic to provide bases for predictive theories. As illustrations of what I mean, the first part of this article is devoted to brief summaries of imaginative, sensible, but disparate and often contradictory ideas for solving glass problems. Almost all of these ideas remain alive today, with their own enthusiastic advocates. I then describe numerical simulations, mostly by H Tanaka and coworkers, in which it appears that very simple, polydisperse systems of hard disks and spheres develop long range, Ising-like, bond-orientational order as they approach glass transitions. Finally, I summarize my recent proposal that topologically ordered clusters of particles, in disordered environments, tend to become aligned with each other as if they were two-state systems, and thus produce the observed Ising-like behavior. Neither Tanaka's results nor my proposed interpretation of them fit comfortably within any of the currently popular glass theories.},

The full density autocorrelation function F ( k ,t ) was also computed. It is found that all F ( k , t) ‘s that we have computed in this work can be fitted over a wide range of time steps (at least over three figures of the decay) by a Williams-Watts stretched exponential function F,(k, t) = A exp[ - (t/to)’],where A, fl and to are adjustable parameters. Other significant dynamical behaviours were also presented in mean square displacements and non-Gaussian parameters for highly supercooled fluids with N = 4000. The present results are compatible to our previous computations with N = 500, but a significant size dependence is suggested.},

One often finds significant deviation from this prediction, in either direction. In supercooled molecular liquids where the ratio τ1∕τ2 falls considerably below 3 (the Debye limit), one usually invokes a jump diffusion model to explain the approach of the ratio τ1∕τ2 to unity. Here we show in a computer simulation study of a standard model system for thermotropic liquid crystals that this ratio becomes much less than unity as the isotropic-nematic phase boundary is approached from the isotropic side. Simultaneously, the ratio τ2∕η, η being the shear viscosity of the liquid, becomes much larger than the hydrodynamic value near the I−N transition. We also analyze the breakdown of the Debye model of rotational diffusion in ratios of higher order orientational correlation times. We show that the breakdown of the DSE model is due to the growth of orientational pair correlation and provide a mode coupling theory analysis to explain the results.},

The new implementation extends the functionality of the original version, provides a much more convenient user interface (both graphical/interactive and batch), and can be used as a tool set for implementing new analysis modules. This was made possible by the use of a high-level language, Python, and of modern object-oriented programming techniques. The quantities that can be calculated by nMoldyn are the mean-square displacement, the velocity autocorrelation function as well as its Fourier transform (the density of states) and its memory function, the angular velocity autocorrelation function and its Fourier transform, the reorientational correlation function, and several functions specific to neutron scattering: the coherent and incoherent intermediate scattering functions with their Fourier transforms, the memory function of the coherent scattering function, and the elastic incoherent structure factor. The possibility to compute memory function is a new and powerful feature that allows to relate simulation results to theoretical studies. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

RATTLE calculates the positions and velocities at the next time from the positions and velocities at the present time step, without requiring information about the earlier history. Like SHAKE, it is based on the Verlet algorithm and retains the simplicity of using Cartesian coordinates for each of the atoms to describe the configuration of a molecule with internal constraints. RATTLE guarantees that the coordinates and velocities of the atoms in a molecule satisfy the internal constraints at each time step. RATTLE has two advantages over SHAKE. On computers of fixed precision, it is of higher precision than SHAKE. Since it deals directly with the velocities, it is easier to modify RATTLE for use with the recently developed constant temperature and constant pressure molecular dynamics methods and with the nonequilibrium molecular dynamics methods that make use of rescaling of the atomic velocities.},

The “replicated data” parallelization strategy is used to achieve reasonable performance with a minimal difference between serial and parallel code. The code has been optimized for high performance in both serial and parallel cases. The model system is completely specified in a run-time input file and may contain atoms, molecules or ions in any mixture. Molecules or molecular ions are treated in the rigid-molecule approximation and their rotational motion is modeled using quaternion methods. The equations of motion are integrated using a modified form of the Beeman algorithm. Simulations may be performed in the usual NVE ensemble or in isobaric and/or isothermal ensembles. Potential functions of the Lennard–Jones, 6-exp and MCY forms are supported and the code is structured to give an straightforward interface to add a new functional form. The Ewald method is used to calculate long-ranged electrostatic forces.},

To ascertain the interface eﬀects, we investigate the dynamical and structural properties of two ILs in nanoscale conﬁnement at various temperatures. Speciﬁcally, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations for ILs composed of 1-butyl-3methylimidazolium cations and hexaﬂuorophosphate ([Bmim][PF6]) or tetraﬂuoroborate ([Bmim][BF4]) anions sandwiched between amorphous silica slabs. Analyses of the structure indicate a bilayered arrangement in the interfacial region and preferred cation orientation at the surface with the methyl groups pointing toward the wall and the butyl tails projected inward. Mean square displacements and incoherent scattering functions reveal slowed and heterogeneous dynamics of all ionic species in the slit pore. In particular, spatially resolved analyses show that the structural relaxation times increase by about 2 orders of magnitude when approaching the silica surfaces. The altered structural and dynamical features of the conﬁned ILs can be related to an existence of preferred sites for the anions on the amorphous silica surfaces. Detailed analyses of relations between the broadly distributed site and the surface properties show that particularly stable anion sites result when triangular arrangements of silanol groups enable multiple hydrogen bonds with the various ﬂuorine atoms of a given anion, elucidating an important trapping mechanism at the silica surface.},

  shorttitle = {Effect of Surface Hydrophobicity on the Dynamics of Water at the Nanoscale Confinement},
  abstract = {We present detailed molecular dynamics simulations of water in and around a pair of plates immersed in water to investigate the effect of degree of hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of the plates on dynamics of water conﬁned between the two plates. The nature of the plate has been tuned from hydrophobic to hydrophilic and vice versa by varying plate-water dispersion interaction. Analyses of the translational dynamics as performed by calculating mean squared displacements of the conﬁned water reveal a monotonically decreasing trend of the diffusivity with increasing hydrophilicity of the plates. Orientational dynamics of the conﬁned water also follows the same monotonic trend. Although orientational time constant almost does not change with the increase of plate-water dispersion interaction in the hydrophobic regime corresponding to the smaller plate-water attraction, it changes considerably in the hydrophilic regime corresponding to larger plate-water dispersion interactions.},

The algorithm is an extension of rigid-body dynamics [Matubayasi and Nakahara, J Chem Phys 1999, 110, 3291] to the NPT ensemble on the basis of non-Hamiltonian statistical mechanics [Martyna, G. J. et al., J Chem Phys 1994, 101, 4177]. A series of MD simulations of water as well as fully hydrated lipid bilayer systems have been undertaken to investigate the accuracy and efﬁciency of the algorithm. The rRB algorithm was shown to be superior to the state-of-the-art constraint-dynamics algorithm SHAKE/RATTLE/ROLL, with respect to computational efﬁciency. However, it was revealed that both algorithms produced accurate trajectories of molecules in the NPT as well as NVT ensembles, as long as a reasonably short time step was used. A couple of multiple time-step (MTS) integration schemes were also examined. The advantage of the rRB algorithm for computational efﬁciency increased when the MD simulation was carried out using MTS on parallel processing computer systems; total computer time for MTS-MD of a lipid bilayer using 64 processors was reduced by about 40\% using rRB instead of SHAKE/RATTLE/ROLL.},

  abstract = {The question of whether the dramatic slowing down of the dynamics of glass-forming liquids near the structural glass transition is caused by the growth of one or more correlation lengths has received much attention in recent years. Several proposals have been made for both static and dynamic length scales that may be responsible for the growth of timescales as the glass transition is approached. These proposals are critically examined with emphasis on the dynamic length scale associated with spatial heterogeneity of local dynamics and the static point-to-set or mosaic length scale of the random firstorder transition theory of equilibrium glass transition. Available results for these length scales, obtained mostly from simulations, are summarized, and the relation of the growth of timescales near the glass transition with the growth of these length scales is examined. Some of the outstanding questions about length scales in glass-forming liquids are discussed, and studies in which these questions may be addressed are suggested.},

This book, first published in 2004, is a blend of tutorial and recipe collection, providing both an introduction to the subject for beginners and a reference manual for the more experienced practitioner. It is organized as a series of case studies that take the reader through each of the steps from formulating the problem, developing the necessary software, and then using the programs to make actual measurements.

Frustration in this context describes an incompatibility between extension of the locally preferred order in a liquid and tiling of the whole space. We provide a critical assessment of what has been achieved within this approach and we discuss its relation with other theories of the glass transition.},

If a given particle is taken to be at the origin O, and if

        (
        r
        )
      
    
    \{\textbackslash{}displaystyle \textbackslash{}rho g(r)\}
  . This simplified definition holds for a homogeneous and isotropic system. A more general case will be considered below.
In simplest terms it is a measure of the probability of finding a particle at a distance of 
  
    
      
        r
      
    
    \{\textbackslash{}displaystyle r\}
   away from a given reference particle, relative to that for an ideal gas. The general algorithm involves determining how many particles are within a distance of 
  
    
      
        r
      
    
    \{\textbackslash{}displaystyle r\}
   and

        r
      
    
    \{\textbackslash{}displaystyle r+dr\}
   away from a particle. This general theme is depicted to the right, where the red particle is our reference particle, and blue particles are those whose centers are within the circular shell, dotted in orange.
The radial distribution function is usually determined by calculating the distance between all particle pairs and binning them into a histogram. The histogram is then normalized with respect to an ideal gas, where particle histograms are completely uncorrelated. For three dimensions, this normalization is the number density of the system 
  
    
      
        (
        ρ
        )
      
    
    \{\textbackslash{}displaystyle (\textbackslash{}rho )\}
   multiplied by the volume of the spherical shell, which symbolically can be expressed as 
  
    
      
        ρ
        
        4
        π
        
          r

        d
        r
      
    
    \{\textbackslash{}displaystyle \textbackslash{}rho \textbackslash,4\textbackslash{}pi r\^\{2\}dr\}
  .
Given a potential energy function, the radial distribution function can be computed either via computer simulation methods like the Monte Carlo method, or via the Ornstein-Zernike equation, using approximative closure relations like the Percus-Yevick approximation or the Hypernetted Chain Theory. It can also be determined experimentally, by radiation scattering techniques or by direct visualization for large enough (micrometer-sized) particles via traditional or confocal microscopy.
The radial distribution function is of fundamental importance since it can be used, using the Kirkwood–Buff solution theory, to link the microscopic details to macroscopic properties. Moreover, by the reversion of the Kirkwood-Buff theory, it is possible to attain the microscopic details of the radial distribution function from the macroscopic properties.},

We focus primarily on the regression of “double error” data, or x−y data pairs, where both variables are measurements subject to error (e.g., isochron fitting), but the methods we discuss are general and can be applied to any nonlinear regression. We review the differences between least squares and maximum likelihood methods and describe how maximum likelihood can be naturally extended to permit robust regressions that are relatively insensitive to outliers. We describe the bootstrap technique for the estimation of the standard error and confidence intervals of a model and show how it can be used to sidestep the mathematical intractability of estimating uncertainty in nonlinear regressions. We illustrate the application of these methods through examples using synthetic and real data and demonstrate how they can influence statistical perception of nonlinear parameter estimates. In particular, we demonstrate how the linearized methods that are commonly used to make uncertainty estimates can substantially underestimate model error, and we show how this problem can be addressed with bootstrap confidence intervals that automatically adjust to account for intrinsic asymmetry and non-Gaussian behavior in a regression. We include computer code to implement the calculations we describe as supplements to this article.},

The \{110\} surface reconstructed to give \{100\} microfacets that are densely packed, and hence the surface disorder was less than the Ni \{111\} surface. The defective (Ni3+) Ni \{111\} surface showed a similar tendency but was less marked, partly due to the increased charge at the surface.

A better understanding of this process would benefit many areas of science and technology such as medicine, biology, and atmospheric and material sciences. In the present work the temperature dependence of the rate of growth (melting) of the basal face of hexagonal ice Ih and the effect of system size are investigated in molecular dynamics simulations. Using an effective pair potential model of water, systems are studied over temperatures ranging from TM − 40 to TM +16 K, where TM is the melting temperature of the model. It is found that the growth rates reach a maximum value of 0.7 Å ns−1 (7 cm s−1) at about 12 K below the melting temperature. A noticeable effect of the system size on the melting temperature and ice growth rates is observed; it is shown that the size effect arises in smaller systems due to the artificial ordering under periodic conditions. The decrease in melting entropy in the smallest system by 0.4 J (mol K)−1 relative to the largest system results in an up-shift in the melting temperature by about 2 K. An almost 60\% increase in the maximum growth rate is observed for the smallest system.},

Here we review the most important ﬁndings in this technologically important area that impact our quantitative understanding of: (i) key anisotropic properties of the solid–liquid interface that govern solidiﬁcation pattern evolution, including the solid–liquid interface free energy and the kinetic coeﬃcient; (ii) dendritic solidiﬁcation at small and large growth rates, with particular emphasis on orientation selection; (iii) regular and irregular eutectic and peritectic microstructures; (iv) eﬀects of convection on microstructure formation; (v) solidiﬁcation at a high volume fraction of solid and the related formation of pores and hot cracks; and (vi) solid-state transformations as far as they relate to solidiﬁcation models and techniques. In light of this progress, critical issues that point to directions for future research in both solidiﬁcation and solid-state transformations are identiﬁed.},

  abstract = {Clathrate hydrates and ice I are the most abundant crystals of water. The study of their nucleation, growth, and decomposition using molecular simulations requires an accurate and efficient algorithm that distinguishes water molecules that belong to each of these crystals and the liquid phase. Existing algorithms identify ice or clathrates, but not both. This poses a challenge for cases in which ice and hydrate coexist, such as in the synthesis of clathrates from ice and the formation of ice from clathrates during self-preservation of methane hydrates. Here we present an efficient algorithm for the identification of clathrate hydrates, hexagonal ice, cubic ice, and liquid water in molecular simulations. CHILL+ uses the number of staggered and eclipsed water–water bonds to identify water molecules in cubic ice, hexagonal ice, and clathrate hydrate. CHILL+ is an extension of CHILL (Moore et al. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2010, 12, 4124–4134), which identifies hexagonal and cubic ice but not clathrates. In addition to the identification of hydrates, CHILL+ significantly improves the detection of hexagonal ice up to its melting point. We validate the use of CHILL+ for the identification of stacking faults in ice and the nucleation and growth of clathrate hydrates. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that allows for the simultaneous identification of ice and clathrate hydrates, and it does so in a way that is competitive with respect to existing methods used to identify any of these crystals.},

  abstract = {Grain boundaries (GBs) influence a wide array of physical properties in polycrystalline materials and play an important role in governing microstructural evolution under extreme environments. While the importance of interfaces is well documented, their properties are among the least understood of all the defect types present in engineering material systems. This is due to the vast configurational space of interfaces, resulting in a diverse range of structures and properties. The complexity associated with GB structures is related to the different crystallographic degrees of freedom – the misorientation, the boundary-plane orientation and the relative translations between the adjoining crystals. These unique challenges can be addressed by leveraging highthroughput simulations of GB properties and developing machine learning algorithms grounded in the concepts of bicrystallography of interfaces. To demystify the relationships between crystallography and properties, the symmetry aspects of GBs are reviewed with an emphasis on boundary-plane orientations and disconnection line defects. To quantify structure-property relationships, recent advances in describing GB structures using the polyhedral unit model and the gaussian-based approximation of local atomic environments are discussed. Finally, examples of predicting GB structure-property relationships using machine learning techniques are summarized. As part of a special issue, the goal of this review article is to motivate machine learning strategies that are informed by bicrystallography and novel structural descriptors for developing reliable crystallographystructure-property relationships for grain boundaries.},

We show that the local environment representation encodes both the information of the structural unit model and additional information, such as distortion in the structural units and the arrangement of the structural units at the interface. The use of the local environment representation permits the use of a visualization tool known as SPRING to represent structural similarities between grain boundaries.

  abstract = {Crystal structure prediction involves a search of a complex configurational space for local minima corresponding to stable crystal structures, which can be performed efficiently using atom–atom force fields for the assessment of intermolecular interactions. However, for challenging systems, the limitations in the accuracy of force fields prevent a reliable assessment of the relative thermodynamic stability of potential structures, while the cost of fully quantum mechanical approaches can limit applications of the methods. We present a method to rapidly improve force field lattice energies by correcting two-body interactions with a higher level of theory in a fragment-based approach and predicting these corrections with machine learning. Corrected lattice energies with commonly used density functionals and second order perturbation theory (MP2) all significantly improve the ranking of experimentally known polymorphs where the rigid molecule model is applicable. The relative lattice energies of known polymorphs are also found to systematically improve with the fragment corrections. Predicting two-body interactions with atom-centered symmetry functions in a Gaussian process is found to give highly accurate results using as little as 10–20\% of the data for training, reducing the cost of the energy correction by up to an order of magnitude. The machine learning approach opens up the possibility of more widespread use of fragment-based methods in crystal structure prediction, whose increased accuracy at a low computational cost will benefit applications in areas such as polymorph screening and computer-guided materials discovery.},

  abstract = {The structure of metallic glasses (MGs) has been a long-standing mystery. On the one hand, MGs are amorphous materials with no long-range structural order; on the other hand, topological and chemical short-to-medium range order is expected to be pronounced in these alloys, due to their high atomic packing density and the varying chemical affinity between the constituent elements. The unique internal structure of MGs underlies their interesting properties, which render MGs potentially useful for various applications. While more and more glass-forming alloys have been developed in recent years, fundamental knowledge on the structural aspect of MGs remains seriously lacking. For example, how atoms pack on the short-to-medium range, how the structure differs in different MGs and changes with composition, temperature, and processing history, and more importantly, how the structure influences the properties of MGs, are still unresolved questions. In this paper, we review the tremendous efforts over the past 50years devoted to unraveling the atomic-level structure of MGs and the structural origin of their unique behaviors. Emphasis will be placed on the progress made in recent years, including advances in structural characterization and analysis of prototypical MGs, general structural models and fundamental principles, and the correlations of thermodynamic, kinetic, and mechanical properties with the MG structures. Some widely observed property–property correlations in MGs are also examined from the structural perspective. The insights summarized are shown to shed light on many intriguing behaviors of the MG-forming alloys and expected to impact the development of MGs. Outstanding questions in this important research area will also be outlined.},

The interaction between boundaries which may lead to their annihilation at higher temperatures, which is a problem when 3D periodic borders are applied, is thus avoided. As an application, the method is used to study the stability of a grain boundary at high temperatures.

In this article we test this suggestion using a single-component Yukawa fluid as a reference system. The available simulation data on self-diffusion in Yukawa fluids, complemented with new data for Yukawa melts (Yukawa fluids near the freezing phase transition), are carefully analyzed. It is shown that although not exact, this earlier suggestion nevertheless provides a very sensible way of normalization of the self-diffusion constant. Additionally, we demonstrate that certain quantitative properties of self-diffusion in Yukawa melts are also shared by systems like one-component plasma and liquid metals at freezing, providing support to an emerging dynamical freezing indicator for simple soft matter systems.

  abstract = {Colloidal particles have the right size to form ordered structures with periodicities comparable to the wavelength of visible light. The tantalizing colours of precious opals and the colour of some species of birds are examples of polycrystalline colloidal structures found in nature. Driven by the demands of several emergent technologies, efforts have been made to develop efficient, self-assembly-based methodologies for generating colloidal single crystals with well-defined morphologies. Somewhat unfortunately, these efforts are often frustrated by the formation of structures lacking long-range order. Here we show that the rational design of patch shape and symmetry can drive patchy colloids to crystallize in a single, selected morphology by structurally eliminating undesired polymorphs. We provide a proof of this concept through the numerical investigation of triblock Janus colloids. One particular choice of patch symmetry yields, via spontaneous crystallization, a pure tetrastack lattice, a structure with attractive photonic properties, whereas another one results in a colloidal clathrate-like structure, in both cases without any interfering polymorphs.},

A slowing down of the growth kinetics along the coexistence line is observed, which is due to the decrease of the melting enthalpy with increasing coexistence temperature and pressure. Other quantities such as the melting pressure and liquid self-diffusion coefficient have a comparatively lesser impact on the kinetic growth coefficient. Growth kinetics of the LJ and WCA potentials become similar at large values of the melting temperature and pressure, when both resemble a purely repulsive soft-sphere potential. Classical models of crystallization from the melt are in reasonable qualitative agreement with our simulation data. Finally, several one-phase empirical melting/freezing rules are studied with respect to their validity along the coexistence line.},

The discrepancy of the results obtained by different criteria is discovered. Heat capacity dependence on temperature agrees qualitatively with theoretical and experimental results. Influence of cooling rate on the glass transition temperature is studied. Although different methods give different glass transition temperatures, the dependencies on cooling rate may be interpreted in the Volkenstein and Ptitsyn's framework using either Arrhenius or Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann relaxation laws.},

Taking into account the relaxation time of the solute diffusion flux in the model equations, the present theory uses, in a first case, the deviation from local chemical equilibrium, and ergodicity breaking. The second case of ergodicity breaking may exist in crystal growth kinetics of rapidly solidifying glass-forming metals and alloys. In this case, a theoretical analysis of dendritic solidification is given for congruently melting alloys in which chemical segregation does not occur. Within this theory, a deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium is introduced for high undercoolings via gradient flow relaxation of the phase field. A comparison of the present derivations with previously verified theoretical predictions and experimental data is given.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Heterogeneous materials: metastable and non- ergodic internal structures’.},

Here we consider whether such suppression of crystallization has a kinetic or thermodynamic nature and investigate its mechanism. We introduce a model in which the degree of fivefold symmetry can be tuned by favouring arrangements of particles in pentagonal bipyramids. We thus show that fivefold symmetry has both kinetic and thermodynamic effects on the mechanism of crystallization to a face-centred cubic crystal. Our results suggest that the mechanism of crystallization suppression is related to the surface tension between fluid and crystal. Interestingly, the degree of fivefold symmetry has little effect on crystal growth rate, suggesting that growth may be only weakly coupled to fluid structure in hard sphere like systems. Upon increasing the fivefold symmetry, we find a first-order transition to an alternative icosahedra-rich phase. At intermediate bias strengths we find a one-component glassformer.},

  abstract = {Solid–liquid interface (SLI) properties of the Ni–Zr B33 phase were determined from molecular dynamics simulations. In order to perform these measurements, a new semi-empirical potential for Ni–Zr alloy was developed that well reproduces the material properties required to model SLIs in the Ni50.0Zr50.0 alloy. In particular, the developed potential is shown to provide that the solid phase emerging from the liquid Ni50.0Zr50.0 alloy is B33 (apart from a small fraction of point defects), in agreement with the experimental phase diagram. The SLI properties obtained using the developed potential exhibit an extraordinary degree of anisotropy. It is observed that anisotropies in both the interfacial free energy and mobility are an order of magnitude larger than those measured to date in any other metallic compound. Moreover, the [0 1 0] interface is shown to play a significant role in the observed anisotropy. Our data suggest that the [0 1 0] interface simultaneously corresponds to the lowest mobility, the lowest free energy and the highest stiffness of all inclinations in B33 Ni–Zr. This finding can be understood by taking into account a rather complicated crystal structure in this crystallographic direction.},

  abstract = {Liquid–liquid transition, a phase transition of one liquid phase to another with the same composition, provides a key opportunity for investigating the relationship between liquid structures and dynamics. Here we report experimental evidences of a liquid–liquid transition in glass-forming La50Al35Ni15 melt above its liquidus temperature by 27Al nuclear magnetic resonance including the temperature dependence of cage volume fluctuations and atomic diffusion. The observed dependence of the incubation time on the degree of undercooling is consistent with a first-order phase transition. Simulation results indicate that such transition is accompanied by the change of bond-orientational order without noticeable change in density. The temperature dependence of atomic diffusion revealed by simulations is also in agreement with experiments. These observations indicate the need of two-order parameters in describing phase transitions of liquids.},

  abstract = {Unlike the well-defined long-range periodic order that characterizes crystals, so far the inherent atomic packing mode in glassy solids remains mysterious. Based on molecular dynamics simulations, here we find medium-range atomic packing orders in metallic glasses, which are hidden in the diffraction data in terms of structure factors or pair correlation functions. The analysis of the hidden orders in various metallic glasses indicates that the glassy and crystalline solids share a nontrivial structural homology in short-to-medium range, and the hidden orders are formulated by inheriting partial crystalline orders during glass formation. As the number of chemical components increases, more hidden orders are often developed in a metallic glass and entangled topologically. We use this phenomenon to explain the geometric frustration in glass formation and the glass-forming ability of metallic alloys.},

  abstract = {Some liquids, if cooled rapidly enough to avoid crystallization, can be frozen into a nonergodic glassy state. The tendency for a material to form a glass when quenched is called “glass-forming ability,” and it is of key significance both fundamentally and for materials science applications. Here, we consider liquids with competing orderings, where an increase in the glass-forming ability is signaled by a depression of the melting temperature towards its minimum at triple or eutectic points. With simulations of two model systems where glass-forming ability can be tuned by an external parameter, we are able to interpolate between crystal-forming and glass-forming behavior. We find that the enhancement of the glass-forming ability is caused by an increase in the structural difference between liquid and crystal: stronger competition in orderings towards the melting point minimum makes a liquid structure more disordered (more complex). This increase in the liquid-crystal structure difference can be described by a single adimensional parameter, i.e., the interface energy cost scaled by the thermal energy, which we call the “thermodynamic interface penalty.” Our finding may provide a general physical principle for not only controlling the glass-forming ability but also the emergence of glassy behavior of various systems with competing orderings, including orderings of structural, magnetic, electronic, charge, and dipolar origin.},

We applied this method to the pure Ni case for a moderate undercooling where no nucleation can be observed in the conventional MD simulation, and obtained nucleation rate in good agreement with the experimental data. Moreover, the method is applied to simulate an even more sluggish event: the nucleation of the B2 phase in a strong glass-forming Cu-Zr alloy. The nucleation rate was found to be 8 orders of magnitude smaller than Ni at the same undercooling, which well explains the good glass formability of the alloy. Thus, our work opens a new avenue to study solidification under realistic experimental conditions via atomistic computer simulation.},

  abstract = {Tetrahydrofuran (THF) clathrate hydrate has been frequently used in experimental studies instead of gas hydrates because it forms at a temperature higher than the ice point under ambient pressure. In this paper, we compare the crystal growth rates of THF hydrate and ice using molecular dynamics simulations. It is demonstrated that the crystal growth of THF hydrate is much slower than that of ice. The growth rates of THF hydrate significantly deviate from a standard kinetic model known as the Wilson–Frenkel model, whereas it reproduces the temperature dependence of the growth rate of ice. The slow crystal growth and the deviation from the Wilson–Frenkel model are attributed to the trapping of THF molecules in open small cages at the hydrate surface. We calculate the free energy profile of a THF molecule transferring from the bulk solution phase to the hydrate surface using the umbrella sampling technique. It is shown that a THF molecule trapped in an open small cage needs to cross one or two free energy barriers to escape from the surface region. We also refer to the similarity between the mechanism of slow growth of THF hydrate and the effect of kinetic hydrate inhibitors.},

This glass-to-crystal (GC) mode can cause crystallization rates orders of magnitude faster than those predicted by standard models. While GC growth is known for 12 systems, its features vary greatly with growth rates spanning a factor of 104. We report that the general condition for GC growth to exist is that liquid diffusion be slow relative to crystal growth according to D/u {$<$} 7 pm. This condition holds for all liquids exhibiting GC growth and suggests that the phenomenon is a solid-state process terminated by fluidity. GC growth must solidify several molecular layers before rearrangement by diffusion. We propose that GC growth propagates by a nonequilibrium crystal/liquid interface 3 nm wide that solidifies by local mobility. These results explain the prevalence of GC growth among organic liquids and guide its discovery in other materials.},

  abstract = {Amorphous solids, or glasses, are distinguished from crystalline solids by their lack of long-range structural order. At the level of two-body structural correlations, glassformers show no qualitative change upon vitrifying from a supercooled liquid. Nonetheless the dynamical properties of a glass are so much slower that it appears to take on the properties of a solid. While many theories of the glass transition focus on dynamical quantities, a solid’s resistance to flow is often viewed as a consequence of its structure. Here we address the viewpoint that this remains the case for a glass. Recent developments using higher-order measures show a clear emergence of structure upon dynamical arrest in a variety of glass formers and offer the tantalising hope of a structural mechanism for arrest. However a rigorous fundamental identification of such a causal link between structure and arrest remains elusive. We undertake a critical survey of this work in experiments, computer simulation and theory and discuss what might strengthen the link between structure and dynamical arrest. We move on to highlight the relationship between crystallisation and glass-forming ability made possible by this deeper understanding of the structure of the liquid state, and emphasise the potential to design materials with optimal glassforming and crystallisation ability, for applications such as phase-change memory. We then consider aspects of the phenomenology of glassy systems where structural measures have yet to make a large impact, such as polyamorphism (the existence of multiple liquid states), ageing (the time-evolution of non-equilibrium materials below their glass transition) and the response of glassy materials to external fields such as shear.},

I suppose that most of us, talking about supercooling a couple of years ago, would have divided substances into two classes, one with simple crystal structures like gold, and all the other ‘good’ metals on the one hand, and those with complex crystal structures, such as glycerol and the silicates on the other; saying that whereas the latter class can be very much supercooled, and will form glasses, the former class can only be supercooled a very few degrees. Then we would have added that there are some ‘ bad ’ metals, with moderately complex crystal structures, such as antimony or bismuth, which can be supercooled some tens of degrees, forming an intermediate class. I think we would then have added that this is quite comprehensible. In particular, that the X-ray diffraction patterns of the monatomic liquids show us that most of the atoms have the right numbers of nearest neighbours in a first co-ordination shell, all ready in place to start the growth of a crystal; which readily explains why these substances cannot be supercooled very much—a nice simple experimental fact, with a straightforward theoretical interpretation—and both are wrong.},

It is shown that the intuitively defined Lattman metric [1] is a scalar multiple of the metric tensor which arises naturally from the Jacobi formulation of the action principle for spherical tops. It is then shown that Euler's quaternion parameters lead to a euclidean form for the orientation metric. These parameters lead to many associated simplifications in the equations of motion of classical rigid bodies including the removal of singularities and spurious behaviour near θ = 0. It is felt that these benefits will translate into increased accuracy and efficiency both for numerical integration of the equations of motion and for performing Monte Carlo integrations of phase space.},

The k-d tree is defined and examples are given. It is shown to be quite efficient in its storage requirements. A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an n record file are: insertion, O(log n); deletion of the root, O(n(k-1)/k); deletion of a random node, O(log n); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches), O(n log n). Search algorithms are given for partial match queries with t keys specified [proven maximum running time of O(n(k-t)/k)] and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average running time of O(log n).] These performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms for these tasks. An algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query. The main focus of this paper is theoretical. It is felt, however, that k-d trees could be quite useful in many applications, and examples of potential uses are given.},

We examine this idea here to show in what senses cross-validation does and does not solve the selection problem. As illustrated empirically, cross-validation may lead to higher average performance than application of any single classification strategy, and it also cuts the risk of poor performance. On the other hand, cross-validation is no more or less a form of bias than simpler strategies, and applying it appropriately ultimately depends in the same way on prior knowledge. In fact, cross-validation may be seen as a way of applying partial information about the applicability of alternative classification strategies.},

  abstract = {Often, in a regression situation with many variables, a sequence of submodels is generated containing fewer variables by using such methods as stepwise addition or deletion of variables, or 'best subsets'. The question is which of this sequence of submodels is 'best', and how can submodel performance be evaluated. This was explored in Breiman (1988) for a fixed X-design. This is a sequel exploring the case of random X-designs. Analytical results are difficult, if not impossible. This study involved an extensive simulation. The basis of the study is the theoretical definition of prediction error (PE) as the expected squared error produced by applying a prediction equation to the distributional universe of (y, x) values. This definition is used throughout to compare various submodels. There can be startling differences between the x-fixed and x-random situations and different PE estimates are appropriate. Non-resampling estimates such as CP, adjusted R2, etc. turn out to be highly biased methods for submodel selection. The two best methods are cross-validation and bootstrap. One surprise is that 5 fold cross-validation (leave out 20\% of the data) is better at submodel selection and evaluation than leave-one-out cross-validation. There are a number of other surprises. /// Dans l'analyse de problèmes de régression à plusieurs variables (indépendantes), on produit souvent une série de sous-modèles constitués d'un sous-ensemble des variables par des méthodes telles que l'addition par étape, le retrait par étape et la méthode du meilleur sous-ensemble. Le problème est de déterminer lequel de ces sous-modèles est le meilleur et d'évaluer sa performance. Ce problème fut exploré dans Breiman (1988) pour le cas d'une matrice X fixe. Dans ce qui suit on considère le cas où la matrice X est aléatoire. La détermination de résultats analytiques est difficile, sinon impossible. Notre étude a utilisé des simulations de grande envergure. Elle se base sur la définition théorique de l'erreur de prédiction (EP) comme étant l'espérance du carré de l'erreur produite en applicant une équation de prédiction à l'univers distributional des valeurs (y, x). La définition est utilisée dans toute l'étude à fin de comparer divers sous-modèles. Il y a une différence étonnante entre le cas où la matrice X est fixée et celui où elle est aléatoire. Différents estimateurs de la EP sont à propos. Les estimateurs n'utilisant pas de ré-échantillonage, tels que le Cp et le R2 ajusté, produisent des méthodes de sélection ayant grand biais. Les deux meilleures méthodes sont la validation croisée et l'autoamorçage. Une surprise est que la validation croisée quintuple est meilleure que la validation croisée tous sauf un. Il y a plusieurs autres résultats surprenants.},

Predefined tests suites for sequences of uniform random numbers over the interval (0, 1) and for bit sequences are available. Tools are also offered to perform systematic studies of the interaction between a specific test and the structure of the point sets produced by a given family of RNGs. That is, for a given kind of test and a given class of RNGs, to determine how large should be the sample size of the test, as a function of the generator's period length, before the generator starts to fail the test systematically. Finally, the library provides various types of generators implemented in generic form, as well as many specific generators proposed in the literature or found in widely used software. The tests can be applied to instances of the generators predefined in the library, or to user-defined generators, or to streams of random numbers produced by any kind of device or stored in files. Besides introducing TestU01, the article provides a survey and a classification of statistical tests for RNGs. It also applies batteries of tests to a long list of widely used RNGs.},

We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm runs faster when the input contains nonextreme points and that it uses less memory. Computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets are well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating-point arithmetic, this assumption can lead to serious errors. We briefly describe a solution to this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or four dimensions. The output is a set of “thick ” facets that contain all possible exact convex hulls of the input. A variation is effective in five or more dimensions.},

Patterns of gene expression can be used to characterize and classify neuronal types. It is challenging, however, to generate taxonomies that fulfill the essential criteria of being comprehensive, harmonizing with conventional classification schemes, and lacking superfluous subdivisions of genuine types. To address these challenges, we used massively parallel single-cell RNA profiling and optimized computational methods on a heterogeneous class of neurons, mouse retinal bipolar cells (BCs). From a population of ∼25,000 BCs, we derived a molecular classification that identified 15 types, including all types observed previously and two novel types, one of which has a~non-canonical morphology and position. We validated the classification scheme and identified dozens of novel markers using methods that match molecular expression to cell morphology. This work provides a systematic methodology for achieving comprehensive molecular classification of neurons, identifies novel neuronal types, and uncovers transcriptional differences that distinguish types within a class.},

  abstract = {Analyzing high-dimensional data poses many challenges due to the “curse of dimensionality”. Not all high-dimensional data exhibit these characteristics because many data sets have correlations, which led to the notion of intrinsic dimensionality. Intrinsic dimensionality describes the local behavior of data on a low-dimensional manifold within the higher dimensional space.We discuss this effect, and describe a surprisingly simple approach modification that allows us to reduce local intrinsic dimensionality of individual points. While this unlikely will be able to “cure” all problems associated with high dimensionality, we show the theoretical impact on idealized distributions and how to practically incorporate it into new, more robust, algorithms. To demonstrate the effect of this adjustment, we introduce the novel Intrinsic Stochastic Outlier Score (ISOS), and we propose modifications of the popular t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualization technique for intrinsic dimensionality, intrinsic t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (it-SNE).},

Details are presented of an A3B binary hard sphere packing obtained by simulated annealing in an isopointal set 62cd/c. The structure has a higher density than all known others when the sphere radius ratio rA/rB is between 0.619 and 0.659786. This extends the known range over which compound binary sphere packings can exceed the density of phase-separated fcc packing. Previously, no packings were known to exceed this mark between a radius ratio of 0.62 and 1.0. The structure of interest has a peak density of 0.747857, which occurs at a radius ratio of 0.647989. A related dense packing is also discussed, which has a peak density of 0.7573 at a size ratio of 0.5147. This latter structure is the densest known noninterstitial compound packing when the mixture has three small spheres for every large sphere, at any size ratio. Both structures are likely candidates for stability in binary hard sphere phase diagrams at this composition, but neither has so far been observed experimentally.},

  abstract = {The melting transition of two-dimensional systems is a fundamental problem in condensed matter and statistical physics that has advanced significantly through the application of computational resources and algorithms. Two-dimensional systems present the opportunity for novel phases and phase transition scenarios not observed in 3D systems, but these phases depend sensitively on the system and, thus, predicting how any given 2D system will behave remains a challenge. Here, we report a comprehensive simulation study of the phase behavior near the melting transition of all hard regular polygons with 3≤n≤14 vertices using massively parallel Monte Carlo simulations of up to 1×106 particles. By investigating this family of shapes, we show that the melting transition depends upon both particle shape and symmetry considerations, which together can predict which of three different melting scenarios will occur for a given n. We show that systems of polygons with as few as seven edges behave like hard disks; they melt continuously from a solid to a hexatic fluid and then undergo a first-order transition from the hexatic phase to the isotropic fluid phase. We show that this behavior, which holds for all 7≤n≤14, arises from weak entropic forces among the particles. Strong directional entropic forces align polygons with fewer than seven edges and impose local order in the fluid. These forces can enhance or suppress the discontinuous character of the transition depending on whether the local order in the fluid is compatible with the local order in the solid. As a result, systems of triangles, squares, and hexagons exhibit a Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) predicted continuous transition between isotropic fluid and triatic, tetratic, and hexatic phases, respectively, and a continuous transition from the appropriate x-atic to the solid. In particular, we find that systems of hexagons display continuous two-step KTHNY melting. In contrast, due to symmetry incompatibility between the ordered fluid and solid, systems of pentagons and plane-filling fourfold pentilles display a one-step first-order melting of the solid to the isotropic fluid with no intermediate phase.},

Due to structure inhomogeneity the amplitude of the mean-square thermal atomic displacements r2 varies spatially. This situation deﬁnes a percolation problem for liquid- and solid-like clusters. There are two percolation thresholds: the ﬁrst corresponds to the temperature T1 at which the ﬁrst inﬁnite cluster of liquid-like particles appears. The second threshold T2 corresponds to a point at which the last inﬁnite cluster of solid-like particles disappears. In the 3D case T1 ≤ Tg ≤ T2 holds. We argue that this interval is relatively broader in strong glass-formers in comparison with fragile ones; this means that the spatial distribution of r2 and, respectively, of the elastic constants is broader in the former case than in the latter one. Comparison with neutron experimental data on r2 shows that numerically T1 is close to the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann temperature T0 and T2 is close to the critical temperature Tc deﬁned within mode coupling theory.},

All systems have \$\textbackslash{}phi\_J\$ significantly below the monomeric value, indicating that trimers' quenched bond-length and bond-angle constraints always act to promote jamming. \$\textbackslash{}phi\_J\$ varies strongly with \$\textbackslash{}theta\_0\$; straight (\$\textbackslash{}theta\_0 = 0\$) trimers minimize \$\textbackslash{}phi\_J\$ while closed (\$\textbackslash{}theta\_0 = 120\^\textbackslash{}circ\$) trimers maximize it. Marginally jammed states of trimers with lower \$\textbackslash{}phi\_J(\textbackslash{}theta\_0)\$ exhibit quantifiably greater disorder, and the lower \$\textbackslash{}phi\_J\$ for small \$\textbackslash{}theta\_0\$ is apparently caused by trimers' decreasing effective configurational freedom as they approach linearity.},

Kinetic coefficient, one of the important parameters that controls solidification growth morphology, is calculated using free solidification method employing two different interatomic potentials. Compared to pure metals, the kinetic coefficients of the ordered systems are smaller by at least an order of magnitude. For the first time, we show here that the growth kinetics of ordered Ni3Al is very sluggish compared to that of the disordered system. The difference is attributed to the diffusion limited growth in the ordered systems vis-á-vis the interface limited growth in their counterpart. Theoretical models by Broughton-Gilmer-Jackson and Wilson-Frenkel are employed to corroborate the identified growth mechanisms. The extent of disorder trapped increases with increasing interface velocity.},

This mosaic significantly changed at times around the period τ of local vibrations, while most particles retain their nearest neighbors for times much longer than τ. In a system of 2500 particles, we found no phase separation for length scales larger than that of a crystallite. With decreasing density, the number of small amorphous clusters increased, and proliferation and percolation of amorphous matter separated the crystalline-ordered parts so that correlations between local order orientations of remote crystallites disappeared.

At temperatures below Tk, the crystal would have a greater entropy than its liquid. Such a catastrophe is avoided through a glass transition of the liquid above Tk. Fecht and Johnson2 have shown that such a transition should occur for aluminium at 0.23 Tm. A similar entropy catastrophe can also arise at a temperature, TiS, above Tm. Above TiS, the crystalline solid is once again expected to have an entropy greater than that of the liquid. Cahn3 has considered the implications of this idea with respect to the superheating of a solid. Here we present an alternative evaluation of the two temperatures of instability, Tk and TiS, from experimentally measurable parameters. Results for alkali metals show that the Kauzmann-type entropy catastrophe occurs at about half the absolute melting temperature, whereas we find that the entropy catastrophe as described by Fecht and Johnson2 occurs at twice the absolute melting temperature. For most solids, vaporization will probably intervene before the entropy catastrophe temperature above the melting temperature is reached.},

The processes involved at an atomic level remain elusive to experiment. Furthermore, crystallization from solution has been thought to be inaccessible by atomistic computer simulations. This study demonstrates that crystallization from solution can in fact be simulated using the method of molecular dynamics for a model solute/solvent system consisting of atomic species characterized by the Lennard-Jones potential function. The model has been applied to look at the effects of varying supersaturation and of inclusion of a simple inhibitor in the system. The behavior of the model is in accord with experiment. In general, increasing supersaturation causes earlier onset of crystallization. Crystallization in highly supersaturated systems involves liquid-liquid phase separation followed by nucleation in the solute phase. The nucleation event in such systems does not appear to be influenced by the solvent. Inclusion of inhibitors retards the onset. Additionally, extensive solute clustering is observed. The crystallization model and variations on it, as well as step by step extension to realistic systems, should enable further testing and development of theory of crystal nucleation and growth and provide insights of technological importance.},

  abstract = {Despite progress in the understanding of crystal nucleation and crystal growth since the first theories for nucleation were developed, an exact quantitative prediction of the nucleation rates in most systems has remained an unsolved problem. Colloidal suspensions show a phase behavior that is analogous to atomic or molecular systems and serve accordingly as ideal model systems for studying crystal nucleation with an accuracy and depth on a microscopic scale that is hard to reach for atomic or molecular systems. Due to the mesoscopic size of colloidal particles they can be studied in detail on the single-particle level and their dynamics is strongly slowed down in comparison with atomic or molecular systems, such that the formation of a crystal nucleus can be followed in detail. In this review, recent progress in the study of homogeneous and heterogeneous crystal nucleation in colloids and the controlled growth of crystalline colloidal structures is reviewed. All this work has resulted in unprecedented insights into the early stage of nucleation and it is also relevant for a deeper understanding of soft matter materials in general as well as for possible applications based on colloidal suspensions.},

  abstract = {We have performed molecular-dynamics simulation to analyze structural phase transitions in a two-dimensional system using a model which has been proposed to study pressure-induced martensitic transformation in iron. At low temperatures, the square↔hexagonal phase transition was observed at P∗=5.4(1) and the reverse transition occurred only by application of tension on the system. At a temperature near the melting point, the hexagonal phase was reached at P∗=3.1(1) and it went back to square symmetry at P∗=1.9(1) showing hysteresis. The activation energy for this transition was evaluated using the nudged elastic band method. Our work permitted to detail the mechanism of square↔hexagonal transformations, contributing for a better understanding about the dynamics of self-organization phenomenon.},

  abstract = {The investigation of the problem of particle packing has provided basic insights into the structure, symmetry, and physical properties of condensed matter. Dense packings of non-spherical particles have many applications, both in research and industry. We report the two-dimensional dense packing patterns of bending and assembled rods, which are non-convexly deformed from simple objects and modeled as entangled particles. Monte Carlo simulations and further analytical constructions are carried out to explore possible densely packed structures. Two typical densely packed structures of C-bending rods are found, and their packing densities are identified as being functions of the aspect ratio and central angle. Six shapes of assembled rods, representing the combined deformations of rods, are employed in simulations with the packing structures classified into three types. The dense packing density of each packing pattern is derived as a function of different shape parameters. In contrast with the case of disordered packings, both the shape and order are verified to affect the packing density.},
