  abstract = {In spite of the great research effort made in Grid technology in the last years, application development and execution in the Grid continue requiring a high level of expertise due to its complex and dynamic nature. The Distributed Resource Management Application API (DRMAA) has been proposed to aid the rapid development and distribution of applications across the Grid. In this paper we present the first implementation of the DRMAA standard on a Globus-based testbed, and show its suitability to express typical scientific applications. The DRMAA routines have been implemented using the functionality provided by the GridWay framework.},

  abstract = {Many courses in scientific fields require students not just to write code, but to also visualize their data, work through a mathematical derivation, or write a paragraph interpreting their results. The Jupyter notebook (formerly known as the IPython notebook) is an ideal platform for creating assignments that include all of these question types, due to its interactive document format that weaves together code, prose, images, and math. Instructors can provide students with self-contained notebooks that include instructions, coding exercises, and written responses all in the same place. Students can write and execute code in these notebooks, and any text or images produced by the code are displayed immediately beneath the input that produced them. However, while having all exercises in the same place makes for better assignments, it also makes them difficult to grade. This demo presents nbgrader, an open-source tool developed by the Jupyter project that solves this problem by providing an interface that blends the autograding of notebook-based assignments with manual human grading. Additionally, nbgrader streamlines the process of assignment creation, distribution, collection, grading, and feedback-a process that is often logistically difficult for instructors. To give students access to the notebook, this demo illustrates how it can be deployed in the cloud, and how this complements the grading process. Information about the Jupyter notebook can be found at http://jupyter.org/, and a demo of the notebook at https://try.jupyter.org/. Information about nbgrader can be found at https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader. A laptop is recommended for this demo. Handouts will be provided.},

addition to interactive exploration. The new architecture also allows
users to work in any language, with implementations in Python, R, Julia,
Haskell, and several other languages. The language agnostic parts of
IPython have been renamed to Jupyter, to better capture the notion that
a cross-language design can encapsulate commonalities present in
computational research regardless of the programming language being
used. This architecture offers components like the web-based Notebook
interface, that supports rich documents that combine code and
computational results with text narratives, mathematics, images, video
and any media that a modern browser can display. This interface can be
used not only in research, but also for publication and education, as
notebooks can be converted to a variety of output formats, including
HTML and PDF. Recent developments in the Jupyter project include a
multi-user environment for hosting notebooks for a class or research
group, a live collaboration notebook via Google Docs, and better support
for languages other than Python.},

To improve the scientific productivity of users, NERSC provides a large number of pre-compiled applications on the Cray XE6 machine, Hopper. Depending on the compiler, compiler flags and libraries used to build the codes, applications can have large differences in performance. In this paper, we compare the performance differences arising from the use of different compilers, compiler optimization flags and libraries available on Hopper over a set of materials science and chemistry applications that are widely used at NERSC. The selected applications are written in Fortran, C, C++, or a combination of these languages, and use MPI or other massage passing libraries as well as linear algebra, FFT, and global array libraries. The compilers explored are the PGI, GNU, Cray, and Intel compilers. It should be emphasized that the compiler optimizations ultimately adopted for production builds are optimizations where the resulting binaries pass strict validity checks and can be used for scientific calculations. These builds do not necessarily represent the highest optimizations the compilers can reach.},

We selected LAMMPS, popular simulation software used in material science, for this study. Both descriptive metadata elements and the types of reuse are examined from a sample of 400 research papers. The results indicate that both descriptive metadata elements and reuse types about LAMMPS are presented in incomplete and inconsistent ways, and this interferes with the values of scientific software, as a type of research data.

To capture and persist the provenance and performance data of these workflows, we have designed and developed the Chimbuko and ProvEn frameworks. Chimbuko captures provenance and enables detailed single workflow performance analysis. ProvEn is a hybrid, queryable system for storing and analyzing the provenance and performance metrics of multiple runs in workflow performance analysis campaigns. Workflow provenance and performance data output from Chimbuko can be visualized in a dynamic, multilevel visualization providing overview and zoom-in capabilities for areas of interest. Provenance and related performance data ingested into ProvEn is queryable and can be used to reproduce runs. Our provenance-based approach highlights challenges in extracting information and gaps in the information collected. It is agnostic to the type of provenance data it captures so that both the reproducibility of scientific results and that of performance can be explored with our tools.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Approaches for computing small molecule binding free energies based on molecular simulations are now regularly being employed by academic and industry practitioners to study receptor-ligand systems and prioritize the synthesis of small molecules for ligand design. Given the variety of methods and implementations available, it is natural to ask how the convergence rates and final predictions of these methods compare. In this study, we describe the concept and results for the SAMPL6 SAMPLing challenge, the first challenge from the SAMPL series focusing on the assessment of convergence properties and reproducibility of binding free energy methodologies. We provided parameter files, partial charges, and multiple initial geometries for two octa-acid (OA) and one cucurbit[8]uril (CB8) host-guest systems. Participants submitted binding free energy predictions as a function of the number of force and energy evaluations for seven different alchemical and physical-pathway (i.e., potential of mean force and weighted ensemble of trajectories) methodologies implemented with the GROMACS, AMBER, NAMD, or OpenMM simulation engines. To rank the methods, we developed an efficiency statistic based on bias and variance of the free energy estimates. For the two small OA binders, the free energy estimates computed with alchemical and potential of mean force approaches show relatively similar variance and bias as a function of the number of energy/force evaluations, with the attach-pull-release (APR), GROMACS expanded ensemble, and NAMD double decoupling submissions obtaining the greatest efficiency. The differences between the methods increase when analyzing the CB8-quinine system, where both the guest size and correlation times for system dynamics are greater. For this system, nonequilibrium switching (GROMACS/NS-DS/SB) obtained the overall highest efficiency. Surprisingly, the results suggest that specifying force field parameters and partial charges is insufficient to generally ensure reproducibility, and we observe differences between seemingly converged predictions ranging approximately from 0.3 to 1.0 kcal/mol, even with almost identical simulations parameters and system setup (e.g., Lennard-Jones cutoff, ionic composition). Further work will be required to completely identify the exact source of these discrepancies. Among the conclusions emerging from the data, we found that Hamiltonian replica exchange - while displaying very small variance - can be affected by a slowly-decaying bias that depends on the initial population of the replicas, that bidirectional estimators are significantly more efficient than unidirectional estimators for nonequilibrium free energy calculations for systems considered, and that the Berendsen barostat introduces non-negligible artifacts in expanded ensemble simulations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {I look to the left… NOTHING?I look to the right… NOTHING?So, I say to myself: There is SOMETHING here…~One of mankind’s successful attempts to find out what that SOMETHING is the Monte Carlo Method.~The method, as well as many of the achievements of mankind, was created for military purposes as part of the scientific tasks associated with the creation of the atomic bomb. The event was super secret and everything was encrypted. The code name of the method – Monte Carlo, has proved to be very successful and has survived in civilization (suck fate has the name of the armoured fighting vehicle – tank).~The task was to create a method for modeling the behavior of a complex probability system. The classic solution is to present the phenomenon with one, two, etc. (but always a limited number) indicators. The new solution is the opposite – \&quot;artificially\&quot; increasing the number of input/output information.~Currently, the Monte Carlo Method is effective, and in some cases – the only one, solution for a wide range of tasks from all areas of scientific knowledge. That is why we’ve decided to present yet another exposure of the foundations and some of the Monte Carlo applications.~The monograph is divided in two parts.~The first part returns the reader during the World War II. We follow the development of the idea of the method and the associated need for creating a powerful enough computer. The first publications are mentioned and are examined the scientific basics of the method and some basic algorithms.~The second part contains applications of Monte Carlo method for solving tasks that can be characterized as \&quot;engineering\&quot;. Without neglecting the concrete results obtained, we will point out that the described approaches for the practical application of the Monte Carlo method are of the greatest interest.},

  abstract = {This article describes the motivation, design, and progress of the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS). JOSS is a free and open-access journal that publishes articles describing research software. It has the dual goals of improving the quality of the software submitted and providing a mechanism for research software developers to receive credit. While designed to work within the current merit system of science, JOSS addresses the dearth of rewards for key contributions to science made in the form of software. JOSS publishes articles that encapsulate scholarship contained in the software itself, and its rigorous peer review targets the software components: functionality, documentation, tests, continuous integration, and the license. A JOSS article contains an abstract describing the purpose and functionality of the software, references, and a link to the software archive. The article is the entry point of a JOSS submission, which encompasses the full set of software artifacts. Submission and review proceed in the open, on GitHub. Editors, reviewers, and authors work collaboratively and openly. Unlike other journals, JOSS does not reject articles requiring major revision; while not yet accepted, articles remain visible and under review until the authors make adequate changes (or withdraw, if unable to meet requirements). Once an article is accepted, JOSS gives it a DOI, deposits its metadata in Crossref, and the article can begin collecting citations on indexers like Google Scholar and other services. Authors retain copyright of their JOSS article, releasing it under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. In its first year, starting in May 2016, JOSS published 111 articles, with more than 40 additional articles under review. JOSS is a sponsored project of the nonprofit organization NumFOCUS and is an affiliate of the Open Source Initiative.},

In the best case, authors may provide their source code as a compressed archive and they may feel confident their research is reproducible. But this is not exactly true. James Buckheit and David Donoho proposed more than two decades ago that an article about computational results is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code, and data that produced the result. This implies new workflows, in particular in peer-reviews. Existing journals have been slow to adapt: source codes are rarely requested and are hardly ever actually executed to check that they produce the results advertised in the article. ReScience is a peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research and encourages the explicit replication of already published research, promoting new and open-source implementations in order to ensure that the original research can be replicated from its description. To achieve this goal, the whole publishing chain is radically different from other traditional scientific journals. ReScience resides on GitHub where each new implementation of a computational study is made available together with comments, explanations, and software tests.},

That is, we suggest that a paper that involves a computer program not be accepted for publication unless the source code becomes publicly available. The adoption of such a policy by editors, editorial boards, and reviewers will improve the ability to replicate scientific results, and will also make computational astronomy methods more available to other researchers who wish to apply them to their data.},

As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

  abstract = {The scientific community across all disciplines faces the same challenges of ensuring accessibility, reproducibility, and efficient comparability of scientific results. Computational neuroscience is a rapidly developing field, where reproducibility and comparability of research results have gained increasing interest over the past years. As the number of computational models of brain functions is increasing, we chose to address reproducibility using four previously published computational models of astrocyte excitability as an example. Although not conventionally taken into account when modeling neuronal systems, astrocytes have been shown to take part in a variety of in vitro and in vivo phenomena including synaptic transmission. Two of the selected astrocyte models describe spontaneous calcium excitability, and the other two neurotransmitter-evoked calcium excitability. We specifically addressed how well the original simulation results can be reproduced with a reimplementation of the models. Additionally, we studied how well the selected models can be reused and whether they are comparable in other stimulation conditions and research settings. Unexpectedly, we found out that three of the model publications did not give all the necessary information required to reimplement the models. In addition, we were able to reproduce the original results of only one of the models completely based on the information given in the original publications and in the errata. We actually found errors in the equations provided by two of the model publications; after modifying the equations accordingly, the original results were reproduced more accurately. Even though the selected models were developed to describe the same biological event, namely astrocyte calcium excitability, the models behaved quite differently compared to one another. Our findings on a specific set of published astrocyte models stress the importance of proper validation of the models against experimental wet-lab data from astrocytes as well as the careful review process of models. A variety of aspects of model development could be improved, including the presentation of models in publications and databases. Specifically, all necessary mathematical equations, as well as parameter values, initial values of variables, and stimuli used should be given precisely for successful reproduction of scientific results.},

In lipid membranes research, particle-based molecular simulations are a powerful tool alongside continuum theory, lipidomics, and model, in vitro, and in vivo experiments. Molecular simulations can provide precise and reproducible spatiotemporal (atomic- and femtosecond-level) information about membrane structure, mechanics, thermodynamics, kinetics, and dynamics. Yet the simulation of lipid membranes can be a daunting task, given the uniqueness of lipid membranes relative to conventional liquid-liquid and solid-liquid interfaces, the immense and complex thermodynamic and statistical mechanical theory, the diversity of multiscale lipid models, limitations of modern computing power, the difficulty and ambiguity of simulation controls, finite size effects, competitive continuum simulation alternatives, and the desired application, including vesicle experiments and biological membranes. These issues can complicate an essential understanding of the field of lipid membranes, and create major bottlenecks to simulation advancement. In this article, we clarify these issues and present a consistent, thorough, and user-friendly framework for the design of state-of-the-art lipid membrane MD simulations. We hope to allow early-career researchers to quickly overcome common obstacles in the field of lipid membranes and reach maximal impact in their simulations.},

  abstract = {The ability to predict transport properties (e.g., diffusivity, viscosity, and conductivity) is one of the primary benefits of molecular simulation. Although most studies focus on the accuracy of the simulation output compared to experimental data, such a comparison primarily tests the adequacy of the force field (i.e. the model). By contrast, the reliability of different simulation methodologies for predicting transport properties is the focus of this manuscript. Unfortunately, obtaining reproducible estimates of transport properties from molecular simulation is not as straightforward as static properties. Therefore, this manuscript discusses the best practices that should be followed to ensure that the simulation output is reliable, i.e. is a valid representation of the force field implemented. We also discuss procedures to use so that the results are reproducible (i.e. can be obtained by other researchers following the same methods and procedures). There are two classes by which transport properties are predicted: equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD). This manuscript presents the best practices for EMD, leaving NEMD for a future publication. As self-diffusivity and shear viscosity are the most prevalent transport properties found in the literature, the discussion will also be limited to these properties with the expectation that future publications will discuss best practices for thermal conductivity, ionic conductivity, and multicomponent diffusivity.},

  abstract = {The efficacy of drug treatments depends on how tightly small molecules bind to their target proteins. The rapid and accurate quantification of the strength of these interactions (as measured by binding affinity) is a grand challenge of computational chemistry, surmounting which could revolutionize drug design and provide the platform for patient-specific medicine. Recent evidence suggests that molecular dynamics (MD) can achieve useful predictive accuracy ({$<$} 1 kcal/mol). For this predictive accuracy to impact clinical decision making, binding free energy computational campaigns must provide results rapidly and without loss of accuracy. This demands advances in algorithms, scalable software systems, and efficient utilization of supercomputing resources. We introduce a framework called HTBAC, designed to support accurate and scalable drug binding affinity calculations, while marshaling large simulation campaigns. We show that HTBAC supports the specification and execution of free-energy protocols at scale. This paper makes three main contributions: (1) shows the importance of adaptive execution for ensemble-based free energy protocols to improve binding affinity accuracy; (2) presents and characterizes HTBAC -- a software system that enables the scalable and adaptive execution of binding affinity protocols at scale; and (3) for a widely used free-energy protocol (TIES), shows improvements in the accuracy of simulations for a fixed amount of resource, or reduced resource consumption for a fixed accuracy as a consequence of adaptive execution.},

By connecting many computing clusters together, QosCosGrid offers easy-to-use mapping, execution and monitoring capabilities for a variety of complex computations, such as parameter sweep, workflows, MPI or hybrid MPI-OpenMP as well as multiscale simulations. Thanks to QosCosGrid, large-scale programming models written in Fortran, C, C++ or Java can be automatically distributed over a network of computing resources with guaranteed Quality of Service – for example guaranteed startup time of a job. Consequently, applications can be run at specified periods with reduced execution time and waiting times. This enables more complex problem instances to be addressed. In order to prove the usefulness of the new functionality of QosCosGrid a detailed description of the system along with a real use case scenario from the quantum chemistry science domain will be presented in this chapter.},

In many cases, resistance can be linked to genetic changes in target proteins, either pre-existing or evolutionarily selected during treatment. Key to overcoming this challenge is an understanding of the molecular determinants of drug binding. Using multi-stage pipelines of molecular simulations we can gain insights into the binding free energy and the residence time of a ligand, which can inform both stratified and personal treatment regimes and drug development. To support the scalable, adaptive and automated calculation of the binding free energy on high-performance computing resources, we introduce the High-throughput Binding Affinity Calculator (HTBAC). HTBAC uses a building block approach in order to attain both workflow flexibility and performance.},

  abstract = {The concept underlying precision medicine is that prevention, diagnosis and treatment of pathologies such as cancer can be improved through an understanding of the influence of individual patient characteristics. Predictive medicine seeks to derive this understanding through mechanistic models of the causes and (potential) progression of diseases within a given individual. This represents a grand challenge for computational biomedicine as it requires the integration of highly varied (and potentially vast) quantitative experimental datasets into models of complex biological systems. It is becoming increasingly clear that this challenge can only be answered through the use of complex workflows that combine diverse analyses and whose design is informed by an understanding of how predictions must be accompanied by estimates of uncertainty. Each stage in such a workflow can, in general, have very different computational requirements. If funding bodies and the HPC community are serious about the desire to support such approaches, they must consider the need for portable, persistent and stable tools designed to promote extensive long term development and testing of these workflows. From the perspective of model developers (and with even greater relevance to potential clinical or experimental collaborators) the enormous diversity of interfaces and supercomputer policies, frequently designed with monolithic applications in mind, can represent a serious barrier to innovation. Here we use experiences from work on two very different biomedical modeling scenarios - brain bloodflow and small molecule drug selection - to highlight issues with the current programming and execution environments and suggest potential solutions.},

Release 4.6 of GROMACS uses SIMD acceleration on a wide range of architectures, GPU offloading acceleration, and both OpenMP and MPI parallelism within and between nodes, respectively. The recent work on acceleration made it necessary to revisit the fundamental algorithms of molecular simulation, including the concept of neighborsearching, and we discuss the present and future challenges we see for exascale simulation - in particular a very fine-grained task parallelism. We also discuss the software management, code peer review and continuous integration testing required for a project of this complexity.},

This paradigm has been slower to infiltrate the catalysis community due to larger configuration spaces, difficulty in describing necessary calculations, and thermodynamic/kinetic quantities that require many interdependent calculations. We present our own informatics tool that uses dynamic dependency graphs to share, organize, and schedule calculations to enable new, flexible research workflows in surface science. This approach is illustrated for the large-scale screening of intermetallic surfaces for electrochemical catalyst activity. Similar approaches will be important to bring the benefits of informatics and data science to surface science research.

  abstract = {A modern biomedical research project can easily contain hundreds of analysis steps and lack of reproducibility of the analyses has been recognized as a severe issue. While thorough documentation enables reproducibility, the number of analysis programs used can be so large that in reality reproducibility cannot be easily achieved. Literate programming is an approach to present computer programs to human readers. The code is rearranged to follow the logic of the program, and to explain that logic in a natural language. The code executed by the computer is extracted from the literate source code. As such, literate programming is an ideal formalism for systematizing analysis steps in biomedical research. We have developed the reproducible computing tool Lir (literate, reproducible computing) that allows a tool-agnostic approach to biomedical data analysis. We demonstrate the utility of Lir by applying it to a case study. Our aim was to investigate the role of endosomal trafficking regulators to the progression of breast cancer. In this analysis, a variety of tools were combined to interpret the available data: a relational database, standard command-line tools, and a statistical computing environment. The analysis revealed that the lipid transport related genes LAPTM4B and NDRG1 are coamplified in breast cancer patients, and identified genes potentially cooperating with LAPTM4B in breast cancer progression. Our case study demonstrates that with Lir, an array of tools can be combined in the same data analysis to improve efficiency, reproducibility, and ease of understanding.

By a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy experiments and multiscale computer simulations, we study the phase transition between two polymorphs. We find that, contrary to intuition, the structure with the lowest packing fraction corresponds to the highest molecular coordination number, due to the competition between surface and intermolecular forces. Having the lowest free energy, this structure spreads out as the most stable polymorph over a wide range of molecular concentrations.},

The GFC method, which is robust to changes in illumination and facial expression, applies the enhanced Fisher linear discriminant model (EFM) to an augmented Gabor feature vector derived from the Gabor wavelet representation of face images. The novelty of this paper comes from 1) the derivation of an augmented Gabor feature vector, whose dimensionality is further reduced using the EFM by considering both data compression and recognition (generalization) performance; 2) the development of a Gabor-Fisher classifier for multi-class problems; and 3) extensive performance evaluation studies. In particular, we performed comparative studies of different similarity measures applied to various classifiers. We also performed comparative experimental studies of various face recognition schemes, including our novel GFC method, the Gabor wavelet method, the eigenfaces method, the Fisherfaces method, the EFM method, the combination of Gabor and the eigenfaces method, and the combination of Gabor and the Fisherfaces method. The feasibility of the new GFC method has been successfully tested on face recognition using 600 FERET frontal face images corresponding to 200 subjects, which were acquired under variable illumination and facial expressions. The novel GFC method achieves 100\% accuracy on face recognition using only 62 features.},

Stability, as determined by the anisotropy of the kinetic coefficient, and the absolute value of the kinetic coefficient, is discussed for solution and melt growth. The slopes of the hillocks which determine the growth rate of the faces increase with supersaturation and, therefore, a singular surface becomes less stable when the supersaturation increases. Nucleation at apexes is also of great importance for the occurrence of instability. The stability of an infinite planar interface against perturbations is considered. The criterion outlined for the growth from an impure melt contains the logarithmic derivative of the kinetic coefficient in addition to the usual parameters describing constitutional supercooling. A singular face turns out to be stable against short-range perturbations even in highly undercooled melts. The stability of polyhedra against perturbation at the apexes is also considered. Analysis of shapes of two-dimensional crystals growing on substrates is considered in connection with the dipole moments of adatoms and aggregates. The repulsion of an adatom from a two-dimensional crystal having a dipole moment of the same sign is weaker at the apexes than at the center of the facet, skeletal shapes being the result.},

The chiral 5-fold-substituted chloro and methyl derivatives do not show this tilt and maintain the 5-fold symmetry as adsorbates. Consequently, a nonperfect tiling is observed. Their lattices are quasi-hexagonal: one in an antiparallel fashion with almost pm symmetry and the other with azimuthal and positional disorder on the hexagonal grid. Our results are in remarkable agreement with computational and mechanical modeling experiments of close packing of hard pentagonal discs in macroscopic two-dimensional systems and prove the validity of such modeling strategies.},

Another 22 structures were rejected because the space group or unit cell was probably misassigned; the rate for that type of error is then only 7\%. The space-group frequencies are unusual; half the structures are in Sohncke groups, partly because the fraction of enantiopure structures of resolvable enantiomers is higher than for lower Z ′ structures. Careful investigation of the 284 structures has shown that they are very diverse; no simple classification can describe them all. Organizing principles have, however, been recognized for almost all of them. The most common features are simple modulations and hydrogen-bonded aggregates; only 14\% of the structures have neither. In 50\% of the structures n molecules are related by a pseudotranslation that would be a crystallographic translation but for small molecular displacements and rotations. In 70\% of the structures there are aggregates ( e.g. n -mers, columns or layers) held together by strong intermolecular interactions; those aggregates usually have approximate local symmetry. Because the n -fold modulations and the n -mers often have n {$<$} Z ′, 85\% of the structures with Z ′ {$>$} 5 have several features that combine to give the high Z ′ value. The number of different molecular conformations is usually small, i.e. one or two in 84\% of the structures. More exotic packing features, such as ordered faults and alternating layers of different types, are found in ca 30\% of the structures. A very few structures are so complex that it is difficult to understand how the crystals could have formed.},

  abstract = {Many liquids cooled to low temperatures form glasses (amorphous solids) instead of crystals. As the glass transition is approached, molecules become localized and relaxation times increase by many orders of magnitude(1). Many features of this 'slowing down' are reasonably well described(2) by the mode-coupling theory of supercooled liquids(3). The ideal form of this theory predicts a dynamical critical temperature T-c at which the molecules become permanently trapped in the 'cage' formed by their neighbours, and vitrification occurs. Although there is no sharp transition, because molecules do eventually escape their cage, its signature can still be observed in real and simulated liquids. Unlike conventional critical phenomena (such as the behaviour at the liquid-gas critical point), the mode-coupling transition is not accompanied by a diverging static correlation length. But simulation(4-10) and experiment(11,12) show that liquids are dynamically heterogeneous, suggesting the possibility of a relevant 'dynamical' length scale characterizing the glass transition. Here we use computer simulations to investigate a melt of short, unentangled polymer chains over a range of temperatures for which the mode-coupling theory remains valid. We find that although density fluctuations remain short-ranged, spatial correlations between monomer displacements become long-ranged as T-c is approached on cooling. In this way, we identify a growing dynamical correlation length, and a corresponding order parameter, associated with the glass transition. This finding suggests a possible connection between well established concepts in critical phenomena and the dynamics of glass-forming liquids.},

  abstract = {Decarburization is an important process during the heat treatment of steels. It can be divided into three separated events: dissolution of carbides, diffusion of carbon through the iron matrix, and surface reactions. The process is very sensitive to temperature. During intercritical annealing, austenite nucleates in the cementite-ferrite interface and grows at the rate determined by the diffusion of carbon in austenite. The presence of a decarburizing atmosphere during annealing guides the carbon diffusion in ferrite toward the surface, generating a flux of carbon from austenite toward ferrite, disturbing the austenite growth. In the presence of pearlite, the ferrite-austenite interface can be assumed to remain static until pearlite is completely dissolved, reducing then the carbon flux in austenite, consequently diminishing the austenite formation rate. At intercritical temperatures, the cementite-free ferrite layer at the surface reaches a greater width due to the combination of the thermodynamic fraction of austenite, dissolution rate of cementite, and the diffusivity of carbon in austenite and ferrite. In this study, an experimental investigation of the effects of the carbide morphology and distribution and the a?c phase transformation in the decarburization kinetics on hypo-eutectoid steels is presented. It is sug- gested that the change of the dissolution kinetics of the carbides due to its morphology will affect the austenitization kinetics. Thus, the distribution of the carbon in the microstructure may determine the rate of decarburization in combination with the carbon diffusion through the phases or the gas-metal reactions.},

A relation between the actual transformed volume V and a related extended volume V1ex is derived upon statistical considerations. A rough approximation to this relation is shown to lead, under the proper conditions, to the empirical formulation of Austin and Rickett. The exact relation is used to reduce the entire problem to the determinatio of V1ex, in terms of which all other quantities are expressed. The approximate treatment of the beginning of transformation in the isokinetic range is shown to lead to the empirical formula of Krainer and to account quantitatively for certain relations observed in recrystallization phenomena.

  abstract = {Dense packings of hard particles have important applications in many fields, including condensed matter physics, discrete geometry and cell biology. In this paper, we employ a stochastic search implementation of the Torquato-Jiao Adaptive-Shrinking-Cell optimization scheme [Nature 460, 876 (2009)] to find maximally dense particle packings in d-dimensional Euclidean space \$\textbackslash{}mathbb\{R\}\^d\$. While the original implementation was designed to study spheres and convex polyhedra in \$d\textbackslash{}ge3\$, our implementation focuses on \$d=2\$ and extends the algorithm to include both concave polygons and certain convex or concave non-polygonal particle shapes. We verify the robustness of this packing protocol by successfully reproducing the known putative optimal packings of congruent copies of regular pentagons and octagons, then employ it to suggest dense packing arrangements of congruent copies of certain families of concave crosses, convex and concave curved triangles (incorporating shapes resembling the Mercedes-Benz logo), and "moon-like" shapes. Analytical constructions are determined subsequently to obtain the densest known packings of these particle shapes. For the examples considered, we find that the densest packings of both convex and concave particles with central symmetry are achieved by their corresponding optimal Bravais lattice packings; for particles lacking central symmetry, the densest packings obtained are non-lattice periodic packings, which are consistent with recently-proposed general organizing principles for hard particles. Moreover, we find that the densest known packings of certain curved triangles are periodic with a four-particle basis, and we find that the densest known periodic packings of certain moon-like shapes possess no inherent symmetries. Our work adds to the growing evidence that particle shape can be used as a tuning parameter to achieve a diversity of packing structures.},

In particular, we define two overlap order parameters, which quantify the correlation between particle configurations at different times, based on a Voronoi construction and the persistence in the resulting cells and nearest neighbors. Temporal fluctuations in the decay of the persistent area and bond order parameters define two alternative dynamic four-point susceptibilities chi(A)(tau) and chi(B)(tau), well suited for characterizing spatially heterogeneous dynamics. These are analogous to the standard four-point dynamic susceptibility chi4(l,tau), but where the space dependence is fixed uniquely by topology rather than by discretionary choice of cutoff function. While these three susceptibilities yield characteristic time scales that are somewhat different, they give domain sizes for the dynamical heterogeneities that are in good agreement and that diverge on approach to jamming.},

  abstract = {Residual dipolar couplings for pairs of proximate magnetic nuclei in macromolecules can easily be measured using high-resolution NMR methods when the molecules are dissolved in dilute liquid crystalline media. The resulting couplings can in principle be used to constrain the relative orientation of molecular fragments in macromolecular systems to build a complete structure. However, determination of relative fragment orientations based on a single set of residual dipolar couplings is inherently hindered by the multi-valued nature of the angular dependence of the dipolar interaction. Even with unlimited dipolar data, this gives rise to a fourfold degeneracy in fragment orientations. In this Communication, we demonstrate a procedure based on an order tensor analysis that completely removes this degeneracy by combining residual dipolar coupling measurements from two alignment media. Application is demonstrated on (15)N-(1)H residual dipolar coupling data acquired on the protein zinc rubredoxin from Clostridium pasteurianum dissolved in two different bicelle media.},

All of our organizing principles are applied to and tested against the most comprehensive set of both convex and concave particle shapes examined to date, including Catalan solids, prisms, antiprisms, cylinders, dimers of spheres, and various concave polyhedra. We demonstrate that all of the densest known packings associated with this wide spectrum of nonspherical particles are consistent with our propositions. Among other applications, our general organizing principles enable us to construct analytically the densest known packings of certain convex nonspherical particles, including spherocylinders, “lens-shaped” particles, square pyramids, and rhombic pyramids. Moreover, we show how to apply these principles to infer the high-density equilibrium crystalline phases of hard convex and concave particles. We also discuss the unique packing attributes of maximally random jammed packings of nonspherical particles.},

  abstract = {When we lower the temperature of a liquid, at some point we meet a first order phase transition to the crystal. Yet, under certain conditions it is possible to keep the system in its metastable phase and to avoid crystallization. In this way the liquid enters in the supercooled phase. Supercooled liquids have a very rich phenomenology, which is still far from being completely understood. To begin with, there is the problem of how to prevent crystallization and how deeply the liquid can be supercooled before a metastability limit is hit. But by far the most interesting feature of supercooled liquids is the dynamic glass transition: when the temperature is decreased below a certain point, the relaxation time increases so much that a dramatic dynamical arrest intervenes and we are unable to equilibrate the system within reasonable experimental times. The glass transition is a phenomenon whose physical origin has stirred an enormous interest in the last hundred years. Why does it occur? Is it just a conventional reference point, or does it have a more profound physical meaning? Is it a purely dynamical event, or the manifestation of a true thermodynamic transition? What is the correlation length associated to the sharp increase of the relaxation time? Can we define a new kind of amorphous order? A shared theory of supercooled liquids and the glass transition does not yet exist and these questions are still largely open. Here, I will illustrate in the most elementary fashion the main phenomenological traits of supercooled liquids and discuss in a very partial way a few theoretical ideas on the subject. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {I shall concentrate upon reviewing the important recent change in our appreciation of the facts of supercooling which has been brought about particularly by the work of Turnbull at the General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady. I suppose that most of us, talking about supercooling a couple of years ago, would have divided substances into two classes, one with simple crystal structures like gold, and all the other ‘good’ metals on the one hand, and those with complex crystal structures, such as glycerol and the silicates on the other; saying that whereas the latter class can be very much supercooled, and will form glasses, the former class can only be supercooled a very few degrees. Then we would have added that there are some ‘ bad ’ metals, with moderately complex crystal structures, such as antimony or bismuth, which can be supercooled some tens of degrees, forming an intermediate class. I think we would then have added that this is quite comprehensible. In particular, that the X-ray diffraction patterns of the monatomic liquids show us that most of the atoms have the right numbers of nearest neighbours in a first co-ordination shell, all ready in place to start the growth of a crystal; which readily explains why these substances cannot be supercooled very much—a nice simple experimental fact, with a straightforward theoretical interpretation—and both are wrong.},

  abstract = {Amorphous solids, or glasses, are distinguished from crystalline solids by their lack of long-range structural order. At the level of two-body structural correlations, glassformers show no qualitative change upon vitrifying from a supercooled liquid. Nonetheless the dynamical properties of a glass are so much slower that it appears to take on the properties of a solid. While many theories of the glass transition focus on dynamical quantities, a solid’s resistance to flow is often viewed as a consequence of its structure. Here we address the viewpoint that this remains the case for a glass. Recent developments using higher-order measures show a clear emergence of structure upon dynamical arrest in a variety of glass formers and offer the tantalising hope of a structural mechanism for arrest. However a rigorous fundamental identification of such a causal link between structure and arrest remains elusive. We undertake a critical survey of this work in experiments, computer simulation and theory and discuss what might strengthen the link between structure and dynamical arrest. We move on to highlight the relationship between crystallisation and glass-forming ability made possible by this deeper understanding of the structure of the liquid state, and emphasise the potential to design materials with optimal glassforming and crystallisation ability, for applications such as phase-change memory. We then consider aspects of the phenomenology of glassy systems where structural measures have yet to make a large impact, such as polyamorphism (the existence of multiple liquid states), ageing (the time-evolution of non-equilibrium materials below their glass transition) and the response of glassy materials to external fields such as shear.},

  abstract = {Some liquids, if cooled rapidly enough to avoid crystallization, can be frozen into a nonergodic glassy state. The tendency for a material to form a glass when quenched is called “glass-forming ability,” and it is of key significance both fundamentally and for materials science applications. Here, we consider liquids with competing orderings, where an increase in the glass-forming ability is signaled by a depression of the melting temperature towards its minimum at triple or eutectic points. With simulations of two model systems where glass-forming ability can be tuned by an external parameter, we are able to interpolate between crystal-forming and glass-forming behavior. We find that the enhancement of the glass-forming ability is caused by an increase in the structural difference between liquid and crystal: stronger competition in orderings towards the melting point minimum makes a liquid structure more disordered (more complex). This increase in the liquid-crystal structure difference can be described by a single adimensional parameter, i.e., the interface energy cost scaled by the thermal energy, which we call the “thermodynamic interface penalty.” Our finding may provide a general physical principle for not only controlling the glass-forming ability but also the emergence of glassy behavior of various systems with competing orderings, including orderings of structural, magnetic, electronic, charge, and dipolar origin.},

We applied this method to the pure Ni case for a moderate undercooling where no nucleation can be observed in the conventional MD simulation, and obtained nucleation rate in good agreement with the experimental data. Moreover, the method is applied to simulate an even more sluggish event: the nucleation of the B2 phase in a strong glass-forming Cu-Zr alloy. The nucleation rate was found to be 8 orders of magnitude smaller than Ni at the same undercooling, which well explains the good glass formability of the alloy. Thus, our work opens a new avenue to study solidification under realistic experimental conditions via atomistic computer simulation.},

  abstract = {Tetrahydrofuran (THF) clathrate hydrate has been frequently used in experimental studies instead of gas hydrates because it forms at a temperature higher than the ice point under ambient pressure. In this paper, we compare the crystal growth rates of THF hydrate and ice using molecular dynamics simulations. It is demonstrated that the crystal growth of THF hydrate is much slower than that of ice. The growth rates of THF hydrate significantly deviate from a standard kinetic model known as the Wilson–Frenkel model, whereas it reproduces the temperature dependence of the growth rate of ice. The slow crystal growth and the deviation from the Wilson–Frenkel model are attributed to the trapping of THF molecules in open small cages at the hydrate surface. We calculate the free energy profile of a THF molecule transferring from the bulk solution phase to the hydrate surface using the umbrella sampling technique. It is shown that a THF molecule trapped in an open small cage needs to cross one or two free energy barriers to escape from the surface region. We also refer to the similarity between the mechanism of slow growth of THF hydrate and the effect of kinetic hydrate inhibitors.},

While GC growth is known for 12 systems, its features vary greatly with growth rates spanning a factor of 104. We report that the general condition for GC growth to exist is that liquid diffusion be slow relative to crystal growth according to D/u {$<$} 7 pm. This condition holds for all liquids exhibiting GC growth and suggests that the phenomenon is a solid-state process terminated by fluidity. GC growth must solidify several molecular layers before rearrangement by diffusion. We propose that GC growth propagates by a nonequilibrium crystal/liquid interface 3 nm wide that solidifies by local mobility.

  abstract = {Although long assumed to have an important role in the suppression of crystallization and the development of glassformers, the effect of local fivefold symmetry has never been directly tested. Here we consider whether such suppression of crystallization has a kinetic or thermodynamic nature and investigate its mechanism. We introduce a model in which the degree of fivefold symmetry can be tuned by favouring arrangements of particles in pentagonal bipyramids. We thus show that fivefold symmetry has both kinetic and thermodynamic effects on the mechanism of crystallization to a face-centred cubic crystal. Our results suggest that the mechanism of crystallization suppression is related to the surface tension between fluid and crystal. Interestingly, the degree of fivefold symmetry has little effect on crystal growth rate, suggesting that growth may be only weakly coupled to fluid structure in hard sphere like systems. Upon increasing the fivefold symmetry, we find a first-order transition to an alternative icosahedra-rich phase. At intermediate bias strengths we find a one-component glassformer.},

  abstract = {Solid–liquid interface (SLI) properties of the Ni–Zr B33 phase were determined from molecular dynamics simulations. In order to perform these measurements, a new semi-empirical potential for Ni–Zr alloy was developed that well reproduces the material properties required to model SLIs in the Ni50.0Zr50.0 alloy. In particular, the developed potential is shown to provide that the solid phase emerging from the liquid Ni50.0Zr50.0 alloy is B33 (apart from a small fraction of point defects), in agreement with the experimental phase diagram. The SLI properties obtained using the developed potential exhibit an extraordinary degree of anisotropy. It is observed that anisotropies in both the interfacial free energy and mobility are an order of magnitude larger than those measured to date in any other metallic compound. Moreover, the [0 1 0] interface is shown to play a significant role in the observed anisotropy. Our data suggest that the [0 1 0] interface simultaneously corresponds to the lowest mobility, the lowest free energy and the highest stiffness of all inclinations in B33 Ni–Zr. This finding can be understood by taking into account a rather complicated crystal structure in this crystallographic direction.},

The observed dependence of the incubation time on the degree of undercooling is consistent with a first-order phase transition. Simulation results indicate that such transition is accompanied by the change of bond-orientational order without noticeable change in density. The temperature dependence of atomic diffusion revealed by simulations is also in agreement with experiments. These observations indicate the need of two-order parameters in describing phase transitions of liquids.},

Based on molecular dynamics simulations, here we find medium-range atomic packing orders in metallic glasses, which are hidden in the diffraction data in terms of structure factors or pair correlation functions. The analysis of the hidden orders in various metallic glasses indicates that the glassy and crystalline solids share a nontrivial structural homology in short-to-medium range, and the hidden orders are formulated by inheriting partial crystalline orders during glass formation. As the number of chemical components increases, more hidden orders are often developed in a metallic glass and entangled topologically. We use this phenomenon to explain the geometric frustration in glass formation and the glass-forming ability of metallic alloys.},

In this case, a theoretical analysis of dendritic solidification is given for congruently melting alloys in which chemical segregation does not occur. Within this theory, a deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium is introduced for high undercoolings via gradient flow relaxation of the phase field.

To ascertain the interface effects, we investigate the dynamical and structural properties of two ILs in nanoscale confinement at various temperatures. Specifically, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations for ILs composed of 1-butyl-3methylimidazolium cations and hexafluorophosphate ([Bmim][PF6]) or tetrafluoroborate ([Bmim][BF4]) anions sandwiched between amorphous silica slabs. Analyses of the structure indicate a bilayered arrangement in the interfacial region and preferred cation orientation at the surface with the methyl groups pointing toward the wall and the butyl tails projected inward. Mean square displacements and incoherent scattering functions reveal slowed and heterogeneous dynamics of all ionic species in the slit pore. In particular, spatially resolved analyses show that the structural relaxation times increase by about 2 orders of magnitude when approaching the silica surfaces. The altered structural and dynamical features of the confined ILs can be related to an existence of preferred sites for the anions on the amorphous silica surfaces. Detailed analyses of relations between the broadly distributed site and the surface properties show that particularly stable anion sites result when triangular arrangements of silanol groups enable multiple hydrogen bonds with the various fluorine atoms of a given anion, elucidating an important trapping mechanism at the silica surface.},

A better understanding of this process would benefit many areas of science and technology such as medicine, biology, and atmospheric and material sciences. In the present work the temperature dependence of the rate of growth (melting) of the basal face of hexagonal ice Ih and the effect of system size are investigated in molecular dynamics simulations. Using an effective pair potential model of water, systems are studied over temperatures ranging from TM − 40 to TM +16 K, where TM is the melting temperature of the model. It is found that the growth rates reach a maximum value of 0.7 Å ns−1 (7 cm s−1) at about 12 K below the melting temperature. A noticeable effect of the system size on the melting temperature and ice growth rates is observed; it is shown that the size effect arises in smaller systems due to the artificial ordering under periodic conditions. The decrease in melting entropy in the smallest system by 0.4 J (mol K)−1 relative to the largest system results in an up-shift in the melting temperature by about 2 K. An almost 60\% increase in the maximum growth rate is observed for the smallest system.},

  abstract = {Crystal structure prediction involves a search of a complex configurational space for local minima corresponding to stable crystal structures, which can be performed efficiently using atom–atom force fields for the assessment of intermolecular interactions. However, for challenging systems, the limitations in the accuracy of force fields prevent a reliable assessment of the relative thermodynamic stability of potential structures, while the cost of fully quantum mechanical approaches can limit applications of the methods. We present a method to rapidly improve force field lattice energies by correcting two-body interactions with a higher level of theory in a fragment-based approach and predicting these corrections with machine learning. Corrected lattice energies with commonly used density functionals and second order perturbation theory (MP2) all significantly improve the ranking of experimentally known polymorphs where the rigid molecule model is applicable. The relative lattice energies of known polymorphs are also found to systematically improve with the fragment corrections. Predicting two-body interactions with atom-centered symmetry functions in a Gaussian process is found to give highly accurate results using as little as 10–20\% of the data for training, reducing the cost of the energy correction by up to an order of magnitude. The machine learning approach opens up the possibility of more widespread use of fragment-based methods in crystal structure prediction, whose increased accuracy at a low computational cost will benefit applications in areas such as polymorph screening and computer-guided materials discovery.},

We find that conventional representations of the input data, such as the Coulomb matrix, are not suitable for the training of learning machines in the case of periodic solids. We propose a novel crystal structure representation for which learning and competitive prediction accuracies become possible within an unrestricted class of spd systems. Due to magnetic phenomena learning on d systems is found more difficult than in pure sp systems. In recent years ab-initio high-throughput computa-tional methods (HTM) have proven to be a powerful and successful tool to predict new materials and to optimize desired materials properties. Phase diagrams of multi-component crystals [1–3] and alloys [4] have been suc-cessfully predicted. High-impact technological applica-tions have been achieved by improving the performance of Lithium based batteries [5–7], by tailoring the non-linear optical response in organic molecules [8] for optical signal processing, by designing desired current-voltage characteristics [9] for photovoltaic materials, by optimiz-ing the electrode transparency and conductivity [10] for solar cell technology, and by screening metals for the highest amalgamation enthalpy [11] to efficiently remove Hg pollutants in coal gasification. However, the computational cost of electronic struc-ture calculations poses a serious bottleneck for HTM. Thinking of quaternary, quinternary, etc., compounds, the space of possible materials becomes so large, and the complexity of the unit cells so high that, even within ef-ficient Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT), a systematic high-throughput exploration grows beyond reach for present-day computing facilities. As a way out, one would like to have a more direct way to access the physical property of interest without actually solving the KS-DFT equations. Machine learning (ML) techniques offer an attractive possibility of this type. ML-based cal-culations are very fast, typically requiring only fractions of a second to predict a specific property of a given ma-terial, after having trained the ML model on a represen-tative training set of materials. ML methods rely on two main ingredients, the learn-ing algorithm itself and the representation of the input data. There are many different ways of representing a given material or compound. While, from the physicists point of view, the information is simply given by the charges and the positions of the nuclei, for ML algorithms},

As a liquid is cooled far below its melting point, dynamics in some regions of the sample can be orders of magnitude faster than dy- namics in other regions only a few nanometers away. In this review, the experimental work that characterizes this heterogeneity is described. In particular, the following questions are addressed: How large are the heterogeneities? How long do they last? How much do dynamics vary between the fastest and slowest regions? Why do these heterogeneities arise? The answers to these questions influence practical applications of glass-forming materials, including polymers, metallic glasses, and pharmaceuti- cals.},

The method uses the basic Parrinello-Rahman (constant-stress) scheme, modified for the application to inhomogeneous systems. Since our computational cell contains only one interface with two-dimensional (2D) periodic border conditions, we are able to study isolated interfaces all the way up to melting. The interaction between boundaries which may lead to their annihilation at higher temperatures, which is a problem when 3D periodic borders are applied, is thus avoided. As an application, the method is used to study the stability of a grain boundary at high temperatures. Observations on a possible connection between grain-boundary migration and ‘‘premelting’’ are discussed.},

  abstract = {The structure of metallic glasses (MGs) has been a long-standing mystery. On the one hand, MGs are amorphous materials with no long-range structural order; on the other hand, topological and chemical short-to-medium range order is expected to be pronounced in these alloys, due to their high atomic packing density and the varying chemical affinity between the constituent elements. The unique internal structure of MGs underlies their interesting properties, which render MGs potentially useful for various applications. While more and more glass-forming alloys have been developed in recent years, fundamental knowledge on the structural aspect of MGs remains seriously lacking. For example, how atoms pack on the short-to-medium range, how the structure differs in different MGs and changes with composition, temperature, and processing history, and more importantly, how the structure influences the properties of MGs, are still unresolved questions. In this paper, we review the tremendous efforts over the past 50years devoted to unraveling the atomic-level structure of MGs and the structural origin of their unique behaviors. Emphasis will be placed on the progress made in recent years, including advances in structural characterization and analysis of prototypical MGs, general structural models and fundamental principles, and the correlations of thermodynamic, kinetic, and mechanical properties with the MG structures. Some widely observed property–property correlations in MGs are also examined from the structural perspective. The insights summarized are shown to shed light on many intriguing behaviors of the MG-forming alloys and expected to impact the development of MGs. Outstanding questions in this important research area will also be outlined.},

The discrepancy of the results obtained by different criteria is discovered. Heat capacity dependence on temperature agrees qualitatively with theoretical and experimental results. Influence of cooling rate on the glass transition temperature is studied. Although different methods give different glass transition temperatures, the dependencies on cooling rate may be interpreted in the Volkenstein and Ptitsyn's framework using either Arrhenius or Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann relaxation laws.},

A slowing down of the growth kinetics along the coexistence line is observed, which is due to the decrease of the melting enthalpy with increasing coexistence temperature and pressure. Other quantities such as the melting pressure and liquid self-diffusion coefficient have a comparatively lesser impact on the kinetic growth coefficient. Growth kinetics of the LJ and WCA potentials become similar at large values of the melting temperature and pressure, when both resemble a purely repulsive soft-sphere potential. Classical models of crystallization from the melt are in reasonable qualitative agreement with our simulation data.

The tantalizing colours of precious opals and the colour of some species of birds are examples of polycrystalline colloidal structures found in nature. Driven by the demands of several emergent technologies, efforts have been made to develop efficient, self-assembly-based methodologies for generating colloidal single crystals with well-defined morphologies. Somewhat unfortunately, these efforts are often frustrated by the formation of structures lacking long-range order. Here we show that the rational design of patch shape and symmetry can drive patchy colloids to crystallize in a single, selected morphology by structurally eliminating undesired polymorphs. We provide a proof of this concept through the numerical investigation of triblock Janus colloids. One particular choice of patch symmetry yields, via spontaneous crystallization, a pure tetrastack lattice, a structure with attractive photonic properties, whereas another one results in a colloidal clathrate-like structure, in both cases without any interfering polymorphs.},

In this article we test this suggestion using a single-component Yukawa fluid as a reference system. The available simulation data on self-diffusion in Yukawa fluids, complemented with new data for Yukawa melts (Yukawa fluids near the freezing phase transition), are carefully analyzed. It is shown that although not exact, this earlier suggestion nevertheless provides a very sensible way of normalization of the self-diffusion constant. Additionally, we demonstrate that certain quantitative properties of self-diffusion in Yukawa melts are also shared by systems like one-component plasma and liquid metals at freezing, providing support to an emerging dynamical freezing indicator for simple soft matter systems. The obtained results are also briefly discussed in the context of the theory of momentum transfer in complex (dusty) plasmas.},

  abstract = {Early stress detection in crop plants is highly relevant, but hard to achieve. We hypothesize that close range hyperspectral imaging is able to uncover stress related processes non-destructively in the early stages which are invisible to the human eye. We propose an approach which combines unsupervised and supervised methods in order to identify several stages of progressive stress development from series of hyperspectral images. Stress of an entire plant is detected by stress response levels at pixel scale. The focus is on drought stress in barley (Hordeum vulgare). Unsupervised learning is used to separate hyperspectral signatures into clusters related to different stages of stress response and progressive senescence. Whereas all such signatures may be found in both, well watered and drought stressed plants, their respective distributions differ. Ordinal classification with Support Vector Machines (SVM) is used to quantify and visualize the distribution of progressive stages of senescence and to separate well watered from drought stressed plants. For each senescence stage a distinctive set of most relevant Vegetation Indices (VIs) is identified. The method has been applied on two experiments involving potted barley plants under well watered and drought stress conditions in a greenhouse. Drought stress is detected up to ten days earlier than using NDVI. Furthermore, it is shown that some VIs have overall relevance, while others are specific to particular senescence stages. The transferability of the method to the field is illustrated by an experiment on maize (Zea mays). © 2014 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).},

We show that CMD is a mean-field approximation to Matsubara dynamics, obtained by discarding (classical) fluctuations around the centroid, and that RPMD is the result of discarding a term in the Matsubara Liouvillian which shifts the frequencies of these fluctuations. These findings are consistent with previous numerical results and give explicit formulae for the terms that CMD and RPMD leave out.},

We have found that real-time dynamics of the ensemble of classical particles acquires quantum nature by introducing a constant quantum mechanical uncertainty constraint on its classical dynamics. The constant uncertainty constraint is handled by the Lagrange multiplier method and implemented into a conventional MD algorithm. The resulting constant uncertainty molecular dynamics (CUMD) is applied to the calculation of quantum position autocorrelation functions on quartic and Morse potentials. The test calculations show that CUMD gives better performance than ring-polymer MD because of the inclusion of the quantum zero-point energy during real-time evolution as well as the quantum imaginary-time statistical effect stored in an initial condition. The CUMD approach will be a possible starting point for new real-time quantum dynamics simulation in condensed phase.},

By virtue of the high-dimensional conformational state space that is explored, the interpretation of large-scale simulations faces difficulties not unlike those in the big data community. We address this challenge by introducing a method called clustering based feature selection (CB-FS) that employs a posterior analysis approach. It combines supervised machine learning (SML) and feature selection with Markov state models to automatically identify the relevant degrees of freedom that separate conformational states. We highlight the utility of the method in the evaluation of large-scale simulations and show that it can be used for the rapid and automated identification of relevant order parameters involved in the functional transit...},

We apply the methods to FCC hard spheres at the melting state. The study shows that, in the best cases, OS and TI are roughly equivalent in efficiency, with a slight advantage to TI. We also examine the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio method, and find that it offers no advantage for this particular application. The PR path shows advantage in general over FL, providing results of the same precision with 2–9 times less computation, depending on the choice of a common reference.

We focus primarily on the regression of “double error” data, or x−y data pairs, where both variables are measurements subject to error (e.g., isochron fitting), but the methods we discuss are general and can be applied to any nonlinear regression. We review the differences between least squares and maximum likelihood methods and describe how maximum likelihood can be naturally extended to permit robust regressions that are relatively insensitive to outliers. We describe the bootstrap technique for the estimation of the standard error and confidence intervals of a model and show how it can be used to sidestep the mathematical intractability of estimating uncertainty in nonlinear regressions. We illustrate the application of these methods through examples using synthetic and real data and demonstrate how they can influence statistical perception of nonlinear parameter estimates. In particular, we demonstrate how the linearized methods that are commonly used to make uncertainty estimates can substantially underestimate model error, and we show how this problem can be addressed with bootstrap confidence intervals that automatically adjust to account for intrinsic asymmetry and non-Gaussian behavior in a regression. We include computer code to implement the calculations we describe as supplements to this article.},

  abstract = {From both the classical and the quantum-mechanical point of view, the description of rotations in NMR is essential for explaining the response of spin systems to radio frequency pulses. Of the many methods used for this description, quaternionic formalisms offer unique advantages. Quaternions are defined and used to introduce Rodrigues quaternions, whose elements in a rotation angle–axis \textbackslash\{\textbackslash{}Phi,\textbackslash{}hat\{\textbackslash{}bf\{n\}\}\textbackslash\} parameterization are defined by the Euler–Rodrigues (ER) parameters \textbackslash\{\textbackslash{}cos\textbackslash{}Phi/2,\textbackslash{}hat\{\textbackslash{}bf\{n\}\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}sin\textbackslash{}Phi/2\textbackslash\}. The utility of Rodrigues quaternions for handling the calculus of rotations via a simple composition rule is emphasized. The traditional use of SO(3) and SU(2) matrix representations of the rotation group in a classical description of NMR is discussed, noting in particular the isomorphism between SU(2) and the group of Rodrigues quaternions. It is this isomorphism that underlies the equivalent utility of the Cayley–Klein parameters or the ER parameters in the classical description of rotations. The rotation angle–axis \textbackslash\{\textbackslash{}Phi,\textbackslash{}hat\{\textbackslash{}bf\{n\}\}\textbackslash\} and the Euler angle \{α, β, γ\} parameterizations of rotations are compared by deriving and solving the corresponding kinematic relations for the ER parameters and the Euler angles \{α, β, γ\}. The linearity of the ER parameter kinematic relations is noted and used to obtain a straightforward solution in the constant-field case. ©1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

  abstract = {The transition of a fluid to a rigid glass upon cooling is a common route of transformation from liquid to solid that embodies the most poorly understood features of both phases1,2,3. From the liquid perspective, the puzzle is to understand stress relaxation in the disordered state. From the perspective of solids, the challenge is to extend our description of structure and its mechanical consequences to materials without long range order. Using computer simulations, we show that the localized low frequency normal modes of a configuration in a supercooled liquid are causally correlated to the irreversible structural reorganization of the particles within that configuration. We also demonstrate that the spatial distribution of these soft local modes can persist in spite of significant particle reorganization. The consequence of these two results is that it is now feasible to construct a theory of relaxation length scales in glass-forming liquids without recourse to dynamics and to explicitly relate molecular properties to their collective relaxation.},

Special attention is hereby given to the value of the Lagrange multiplier and the complexity of terms representing the inertia forces. Particular attention is also paid to the rotational generalized external force vector, which is not unique when using Euler parameters as rotational coordinates.},

It finds applications in stereophotogrammetry and in robotics. I present here a closed-form solution to the least-squares problem for three or more points. Currently various empirical, graphical, and numerical iterative methods are in use. Derivation of the solution is simplified by use of unit quaternions to represent rotation. I emphasize a symmetry property that a solution to this problem ought to possess. The best translational offset is the difference between the centroid of the coordinates in one system and the rotated and scaled centroid of the coordinates in the other system. The best scale is equal to the ratio of the root-mean-square deviations of the coordinates in the two systems from their respective centroids. These exact results are to be preferred to approximate methods based on measurements of a few selected points. The unit quaternion representing the best rotation is the eigenvector associated with the most positive eigenvalue of a symmetric 4 × 4 matrix. The elements of this matrix are combinations of sums of products of corresponding coordinates of the points.},

We start with a broad introduction to the field and emphasize its connections with other subjects and its relevance. The important role played by computer simulations in studying and understanding the dynamics of systems close to the glass transition at the molecular level is given. The recent progress on the subject of the spatially heterogeneous dynamics that characterizes structural relaxation in materials with slow dynamics is reviewed. The main theoretical approaches are presented describing the glass transition in supercooled liquids, focusing on theories that have a microscopic, statistical mechanics basis. We describe both successes and failures and critically assess the current status of each of these approaches. The physics of aging dynamics in disordered materials and the rheology of soft glassy materials are then discussed, and recent theoretical progress is described. For each section, an extensive overview is given of the most recent advances, but we also describe in some detail the important open problems that will occupy a central place in this field in the coming years.

We discuss the algorithms that are used to exploit the processing power of the GPUs and show the performance that can be achieved in comparison to simulations on conventional CPU clusters. The implementation supports three different precision models in which the contributions to the forces are calculated in single precision floating point arithmetic but accumulated in double precision (SPDP), or everything is computed in single precision (SPSP) or double precision (DPDP). In addition to performance, we have focused on understanding the implications of the different precision models on the outcome of implicit solvent MD simulations. We show results for a range of tests including the accuracy of single point force evaluations and energy conservation as well as structural properties pertainining to protein dynamics. The numerical noise due to rounding errors within the SPSP precision model is sufficiently large to lead to an accumulation of errors which can result in unphysical trajectories for long time scale simulations. We recommend the use of the mixed-precision SPDP model since the numerical results obtained are comparable with those of the full double precision DPDP model and the reference double precision CPU implementation but at significantly reduced computational cost. Our implementation provides performance for GB simulations on a single desktop that is on par with, and in some cases exceeds, that of traditional supercomputers.},

Extending these basic methods with rigid body constraints enables composite particles with complex shapes such as anisotropic nanoparticles, grains, molecules, and rigid proteins to be modeled. Rigid body constraints are added to the GPU-accelerated MD package, HOOMD-blue, version 0.10.0. The software can now simulate systems of particles, rigid bodies, or mixed systems in microcanonical (NVE), canonical (NVT), and isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensembles. It can also apply the FIRE energy minimization technique to these systems. In this paper, we detail the massively parallel scheme that implements these algorithms and discuss how our design is tuned for the maximum possible performance. Two different case studies are included to demonstrate the performance attained, patchy spheres and tethered nanorods. In typical cases, HOOMD-blue on a single GTX 480 executes 2.5–3.6 times faster than LAMMPS executing the same simulation on any number of CPU cores in parallel. Simulations with rigid bodies may now be run with larger systems and for longer time scales on a single workstation than was previously even possible on large clusters.},

We also adopt a quaternion-based approach that computes Drot orientation directly from autocorrelations of best-fit rotations as used in, e.g., RMSD algorithms. Over 2 μs trajectories, isotropic MARTINI+EN tumbling replicates experimental values to within 10–20\%, with convergence analyses suggesting a minimum sampling of {$>$}50 × τtheor to achieve sufficient precision. Transient fluctuations in anisotropic tumbling cause decreased precision in predictions of axisymmetric anisotropy and r...},

To these we add a fourth, the rotation vector, which has many of the benefits of both Euler angles and quaternions, but neither the singularities of the former, nor the quadratic constraint of the latter. There are several other subsidiary representations, such as Cayley-Klein parameters and the axis-angle representation, whose relations to the three main representations are also described. Our exposition is catered to those who seek a thorough and unified reference on the whole subject; detailed derivations of some results are not presented.},

We describe how GPUs can be used to considerably speed up molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for system sizes ranging up to about 1 million particles. Particular emphasis is put on the numerical long-time stability in terms of energy and momentum conservation, and caveats on limited floating-point precision are issued. Strict energy conservation over 108 MD steps is obtained by double-single emulation of the floating-point arithmetic in accuracy-critical parts of the algorithm. For the slow dynamics of a supercooled binary Lennard-Jones mixture, we demonstrate that the use of single-floating point precision may result in quantitatively and even physically wrong results. For simulations of a Lennard-Jones fluid, the described implementation shows speedup factors of up to 80 compared to a serial implementation for the CPU, and a single CPU was found to compare with a parallelised MD simulation using 64 distributed cores.

The most common way of making a glass is by cooling a viscous liquid fast enough to avoid crystallization. Although this route to the vitreous state-supercooling-has been known for millennia, the molecular processes by which liquids acquire amorphous rigidity upon cooling are not fully understood. Here we discuss current theoretical knowledge of the manner in which intermolecular forces give rise to complex behaviour in supercooled liquids and glasses. An intriguing aspect of this behaviour is the apparent connection between dynamics and thermodynamics. The multidimensional potential energy surface as a function of particle coordinates (the energy landscape) offers a convenient viewpoint for the analysis and interpretation of supercooling and glass-formation phenomena. That much of this analysis is at present largely qualitative reflects the fact that precise computations of how viscous liquids sample their landscape have become possible only recently.},

We show that spatial correlations exist among particles undergoing extremely large ("mobile") or extremely small ("immobile") displacements over a suitably chosen time interval. The immobile particles form the cores of relatively compact clusters, while the mobile particles move cooperatively and form quasi-one-dimensional, stringlike clusters. The strength and length scale of the correlations between mobile particles are found to grow strongly with decreasing temperature, and the mean cluster size appears to diverge near the mode-coupling critical temperature. We show that these correlations in the particle displacements are related to equilibrium fluctuations in the local potential energy and local composition.},

  abstract = {The Debye-Stokes-Einstein (DSE) model of rotational diffusion predicts that the orientational correlation times τl vary as [l(l+1)]−1, where l is the rank of the orientational time correlation function (given in terms of the Legendre polynomial of rank l). One often finds significant deviation from this prediction, in either direction. In supercooled molecular liquids where the ratio τ1∕τ2 falls considerably below 3 (the Debye limit), one usually invokes a jump diffusion model to explain the approach of the ratio τ1∕τ2 to unity. Here we show in a computer simulation study of a standard model system for thermotropic liquid crystals that this ratio becomes much less than unity as the isotropic-nematic phase boundary is approached from the isotropic side. Simultaneously, the ratio τ2∕η, η being the shear viscosity of the liquid, becomes much larger than the hydrodynamic value near the I−N transition. We also analyze the breakdown of the Debye model of rotational diffusion in ratios of higher order orientational correlation times. We show that the breakdown of the DSE model is due to the growth of orientational pair correlation and provide a mode coupling theory analysis to explain the results.},

The new implementation extends the functionality of the original version, provides a much more convenient user interface (both graphical/interactive and batch), and can be used as a tool set for implementing new analysis modules. This was made possible by the use of a high-level language, Python, and of modern object-oriented programming techniques. The quantities that can be calculated by nMoldyn are the mean-square displacement, the velocity autocorrelation function as well as its Fourier transform (the density of states) and its memory function, the angular velocity autocorrelation function and its Fourier transform, the reorientational correlation function, and several functions specific to neutron scattering: the coherent and incoherent intermediate scattering functions with their Fourier transforms, the memory function of the coherent scattering function, and the elastic incoherent structure factor.

The code has been optimized for high performance in both serial and parallel cases. The model system is completely specified in a run-time input file and may contain atoms, molecules or ions in any mixture. Molecules or molecular ions are treated in the rigid-molecule approximation and their rotational motion is modeled using quaternion methods. The equations of motion are integrated using a modified form of the Beeman algorithm. Simulations may be performed in the usual NVE ensemble or in isobaric and/or isothermal ensembles. Potential functions of the Lennard–Jones, 6-exp and MCY forms are supported and the code is structured to give an straightforward interface to add a new functional form.

  abstract = {We present detailed molecular dynamics simulations of water in and around a pair of plates immersed in water to investigate the effect of degree of hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of the plates on dynamics of water confined between the two plates. The nature of the plate has been tuned from hydrophobic to hydrophilic and vice versa by varying plate-water dispersion interaction. Analyses of the translational dynamics as performed by calculating mean squared displacements of the confined water reveal a monotonically decreasing trend of the diffusivity with increasing hydrophilicity of the plates. Orientational dynamics of the confined water also follows the same monotonic trend. Although orientational time constant almost does not change with the increase of plate-water dispersion interaction in the hydrophobic regime corresponding to the smaller plate-water attraction, it changes considerably in the hydrophilic regime corresponding to larger plate-water dispersion interactions.},

The algorithm is an extension of rigid-body dynamics [Matubayasi and Nakahara, J Chem Phys 1999, 110, 3291] to the NPT ensemble on the basis of non-Hamiltonian statistical mechanics [Martyna, G. J. et al., J Chem Phys 1994, 101, 4177]. A series of MD simulations of water as well as fully hydrated lipid bilayer systems have been undertaken to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm. The rRB algorithm was shown to be superior to the state-of-the-art constraint-dynamics algorithm SHAKE/RATTLE/ROLL, with respect to computational efficiency. However, it was revealed that both algorithms produced accurate trajectories of molecules in the NPT as well as NVT ensembles, as long as a reasonably short time step was used. A couple of multiple time-step (MTS) integration schemes were also examined. The advantage of the rRB algorithm for computational efficiency increased when the MD simulation was carried out using MTS on parallel processing computer systems; total computer time for MTS-MD of a lipid bilayer using 64 processors was reduced by about 40\% using rRB instead of SHAKE/RATTLE/ROLL.},

  abstract = {The question of whether the dramatic slowing down of the dynamics of glass-forming liquids near the structural glass transition is caused by the growth of one or more correlation lengths has received much attention in recent years. Several proposals have been made for both static and dynamic length scales that may be responsible for the growth of timescales as the glass transition is approached. These proposals are critically examined with emphasis on the dynamic length scale associated with spatial heterogeneity of local dynamics and the static point-to-set or mosaic length scale of the random firstorder transition theory of equilibrium glass transition. Available results for these length scales, obtained mostly from simulations, are summarized, and the relation of the growth of timescales near the glass transition with the growth of these length scales is examined. Some of the outstanding questions about length scales in glass-forming liquids are discussed, and studies in which these questions may be addressed are suggested.},

This book, first published in 2004, is a blend of tutorial and recipe collection, providing both an introduction to the subject for beginners and a reference manual for the more experienced practitioner. It is organized as a series of case studies that take the reader through each of the steps from formulating the problem, developing the necessary software, and then using the programs to make actual measurements.

Frustration in this context describes an incompatibility between extension of the locally preferred order in a liquid and tiling of the whole space. We provide a critical assessment of what has been achieved within this approach and we discuss its relation with other theories of the glass transition.},

The full density autocorrelation function F ( k ,t ) was also computed. It is found that all F ( k , t) ‘s that we have computed in this work can be fitted over a wide range of time steps (at least over three figures of the decay) by a Williams-Watts stretched exponential function F,(k, t) = A exp[ - (t/to)’],where A, fl and to are adjustable parameters. Other significant dynamical behaviours were also presented in mean square displacements and non-Gaussian parameters for highly supercooled fluids with N = 4000. The present results are compatible to our previous computations with N = 500, but a significant size dependence is suggested.},

  abstract = {Glasses can be formed by many routes. In some cases, distinct polyamorphic forms are found. The normal mode of glass formation is cooling of a viscous liquid. Liquid behavior during cooling is classified between "strong" and "fragile," and the three canonical characteristics of relaxing liquids are correlated through the fragility. Strong liquids become fragile liquids on compression. In some cases, such conversions occur during cooling by a weak first-order transition. This behavior can be related to the polymorphism in a glass state through a recent simple modification of the van der Waals model for tetrahedrally bonded liquids. The sudden loss of some liquid degrees of freedom through such first-order transitions is suggestive of the polyamorphic transition between native and denatured hydrated proteins, which can be interpreted as single-chain glass-forming polymers plasticized by water and cross-linked by hydrogen bonds. The onset of a sharp change in d{$<$}r2{$>$}dT({$<$}r2{$>$} is the Debye-Waller factor and T is temperature) in proteins, which is controversially indentified with the glass transition in liquids, is shown to be general for glass formers and observable in computer simulations of strong and fragile ionic liquids, where it proves to be close to the experimental glass transition temperature. The latter may originate in strong anharmonicity in modes ("bosons"), which permits the system to access multiple minima of its configuration space. These modes, the Kauzmann temperature TK, and the fragility of the liquid, may thus be connected.},

It seems to me that we have too often been led astray by sophisticated mathematical models that beautifully capture some of the most intriguing features of glassy behavior, but are too unrealistic to provide bases for predictive theories. As illustrations of what I mean, the first part of this article is devoted to brief summaries of imaginative, sensible, but disparate and often contradictory ideas for solving glass problems. Almost all of these ideas remain alive today, with their own enthusiastic advocates. I then describe numerical simulations, mostly by H Tanaka and coworkers, in which it appears that very simple, polydisperse systems of hard disks and spheres develop long range, Ising-like, bond-orientational order as they approach glass transitions. Finally, I summarize my recent proposal that topologically ordered clusters of particles, in disordered environments, tend to become aligned with each other as if they were two-state systems, and thus produce the observed Ising-like behavior. Neither Tanaka's results nor my proposed interpretation of them fit comfortably within any of the currently popular glass theories.},

  abstract = {With more than a hundred elements in the periodic table, a large number of potential new materials exist to address the technological and societal challenges we face today; however, without some guidance, searching through this vast combinatorial space is frustratingly slow and expensive, especially for materials strongly influenced by processing. We train a machine learning (ML) model on previously reported observations, parameters from physiochemical theories, and make it synthesis method–dependent to guide high-throughput (HiTp) experiments to find a new system of metallic glasses in the Co-V-Zr ternary. Experimental observations are in good agreement with the predictions of the model, but there are quantitative discrepancies in the precise compositions predicted. We use these discrepancies to retrain the ML model. The refined model has significantly improved accuracy not only for the Co-V-Zr system but also across all other available validation data. We then use the refined model to guide the discovery of metallic glasses in two additional previously unreported ternaries. Although our approach of iterative use of ML and HiTp experiments has guided us to rapid discovery of three new glass-forming systems, it has also provided us with a quantitatively accurate, synthesis method–sensitive predictor for metallic glasses that improves performance with use and thus promises to greatly accelerate discovery of many new metallic glasses. We believe that this discovery paradigm is applicable to a wider range of materials and should prove equally powerful for other materials and properties that are synthesis path–dependent and that current physiochemical theories find challenging to predict.},

This mosaic significantly changed at times around the period τ of local vibrations, while most particles retain their nearest neighbors for times much longer than τ. In a system of 2500 particles, we found no phase separation for length scales larger than that of a crystallite. With decreasing density, the number of small amorphous clusters increased, and proliferation and percolation of amorphous matter separated the crystalline-ordered parts so that correlations between local order orientations of remote crystallites disappeared. We suggest that the mosaic is a manifestation of diminished stability of the crystalline structure resulting from competition between attraction and repulsion forces.},

The two crystal polymorphs displayed unique nucleation pathways with their own building blocks for nucleus formation. The prismatic polymorph and the gel state shared the same fibrous precursor, and a fragment of the gel grew into new prismatic crystals. The authors analysed the intermolecular mode of binding and found that polymorphs could be selected by tuning the relative strengths of anisotropic versus isotropic attraction between the monomers. This enabled them to knock out specific polymorph growth via site-directed mutagenesis to tune the strength of attraction at specific contact sites. The authors hope that these insights could lead to new polymorph selection strategies of interest in medicine, structural biology and protein-based drug-delivery applications.},

  abstract = {The fluid phase diagram of trimer particles composed of one central attractive bead and two repulsive beads was determined as a function of simple geometric parameters using flat-histogram Monte Carlo methods. A variety of self-assembled structures were obtained including spherical micelle-like clusters, elongated clusters, and densely packed cylinders, depending on both the state conditions and shape of the trimer. Advanced simulation techniques were employed to determine transitions between self-assembled structures and macroscopic phases using thermodynamic and structural definitions. Simple changes in particle geometry yield dramatic changes in phase behavior, ranging from macroscopic fluid phase separation to molecular-scale self-assembly. In special cases, both self-assembled, elongated clusters and bulk fluid phase separation occur simultaneously. Our work suggests that tuning particle shape and interactions can yield superstructures with controlled architecture.},

In this paper we have adapted our previously developed molecular dynamics simulation methodology to enable the investigation of steady-state directional crystal growth/melting of ice. Specifically, we examine ice/water systems of the (001), (110), and (111) faces of ice Ic and the (0001), (101¯0), and (112¯0) faces of ice Ih, where the TIP4P, TIP4P-Ew, and SPC/E water models have been utilized. The influence of different growth/melting conditions (temperature gradients and growth velocities) is investigated. Profile functions of properties of interest across the interface are obtained from nonequilibrium steady-state simulations and provide consistent descriptions of ice/water interfaces. The widths of the various crystallographic faces are found to increase in the apparent order Ic111, Ih0001 {$<$} Ih 101¯0 {$<$} Ih 112¯0 {$<$} Ic001 {$<$} Ic110. The observed growt...},

Many interesting physical phenomena, like crystal nucleation and growth, vacancy motion, and glassy dynamics are challenging to model in these systems because they require detailed dynamical information at the individual particle level. Within the granular materials community the Discrete Element Method has been used extensively to model systems of anisotropic particles under gravity, with friction. We provide an implementation of this method intended for simulation of hard, faceted nanoparticles, with a conservative Weeks–Chandler–Andersen (WCA) interparticle potential, coupled to a thermodynamic ensemble. This method is a natural extension of classical molecular dynamics and enables rigorous thermodynamic calculations for faceted particles.},

The method was devised to carry out Molecular Dynamics simulations of complex molecular systems with some internal degrees of freedom frozen, in terms of atomic Cartesian coordinates. The method has been subsequently generalized to treat all kinds of holonomic constraints and has been adapted to the more recent dynamical simulations in ensembles different from the microcanonical one. We start by deriving the statistical-mechanical formalism for these systems. We then proceed to derive the equations of motion. We conclude with a detailed discussion of the relevant MD algorithms. Some technical details on the FORTRAN code are presented in an appendix. ?? 1986.},

  abstract = {The Stokes–Einstein–Debye (SED) expression is used routinely to relate orientational molecular diffusivity quantitatively to viscosity. However, it is well-known that Einstein’s equations are derived from hydrodynamic theory for the diffusion of a Brownian particle in a homogeneous fluid and examples of SED breakdown and failure for molecular diffusion are not unusual. Here, using optical Kerr-effect spectroscopy to measure orientational diffusion for solutions of guanidine hydrochloride in water and mixtures of carbon disulfide with hexadecane, we show that these two contrasting systems each show pronounced exception to the SED relation and ask if it is reasonable to expect molecular diffusion to be a simple function of viscosity.},

  abstract = {Jammed packings of granular materials differ from systems normally described by statistical mechanics in that they are athermal. In recent years a statistical mechanics of static granular media has emerged where the thermodynamic temperature is replaced by a configurational temperature X which describes how the number of mechanically stable configurations depends on the volume. Four different methods have been suggested to measure X. Three of them are computed from properties of the Voronoi volume distribution, the fourth takes into account the contact number and the global volume fraction. This paper answers two questions using experimental binary disc packings: first we test if the four methods to measure compactivity provide identical results when applied to the same dataset. We find that only two of the methods agree quantitatively. This implies that at least two of the four methods are wrong. Secondly, we test if X is indeed an intensive variable; this becomes true only for samples larger than roughly 200 particles. This result is shown to be due to recently measured correlations between the particle volumes [Zhao et al., Europhys. Lett., 2012, 97, 34004].},

Recent experiments indicate that glasses prepared by vapour deposition onto a substrate can exhibit remarkable stability, and might correspond to equilibrium states that could hitherto be reached only by glasses aged for thousands of years. Here we create ultrastable glasses by means of a computer-simulation process that mimics physical vapour deposition. These stable glasses have, far below the conventional glass-transition temperature, the properties expected for the equilibrium supercooled liquid state, and optimal stability is attained when deposition occurs at the Kauzmann temperature. We also show that the glasses' extraordinary stability is associated with distinct structural motifs, in particular the abundance of regular Voronoi polyhedra and the relative lack of irregular polyhedra.},

  abstract = {Fossil amber offers the opportunity to investigate the dynamics of glass-forming materials far below the nominal glass transition temperature. This is important in the context of classical theory, as well as some new theories that challenge the idea of an 'ideal' glass transition. Here we report results from calorimetric and stress relaxation experiments using a 20-million-year-old Dominican amber. By performing the stress relaxation experiments in a step-wise fashion, we measured the relaxation time at each temperature and, above the fictive temperature of this 20-million-year-old glass, this is an upper bound to the equilibrium relaxation time. The results deviate dramatically from the expectation of classical theory and are consistent with some modern ideas, in which the diverging timescale signature of complex fluids disappears below the glass transition temperature.},

Due to structure inhomogeneity the amplitude of the mean-square thermal atomic displacements \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/langle.gif] \{langle\} r 2 \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rangle.gif] \{rangle\} varies spatially. This situation defines a percolation problem for liquid- and solid-like clusters. There are two percolation thresholds: the first corresponds to the temperature T 1 at which the first infinite cluster of liquid-like particles appears. The second threshold T 2 corresponds to a point at which the last infinite cluster of solid-like particles disappears. In the 3D case T 1 ≤ T g ≤ T 2 holds. We argue that this interval is relatively broader in strong glass-formers in comparison with fragile ones; this means that the spatial distribution of \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/langle.gif] \{langle\} r 2 \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rangle.gif] \{rangle\} and, respectively, of the elastic constants is broader in the former case than in the latter one. Comparison with neutron experimental data on \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/langle.gif] \{langle\} r 2 \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rangle.gif] \{rangle\} shows that numerically T 1 is close to the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann temperature T 0 and T 2 is close to the critical temperature T c defined within mode coupling theory.},

This precision model replaces double precision arithmetic with fixed point integer arithmetic for the accumulation of force components as compared to a previously introduced model that uses mixed single/double precision arithmetic. This significantly boosts performance on modern GPU hardware without sacrificing numerical accuracy. We present an implementation for NVIDIA GPUs of both generalized Born implicit solvent simulations as well as explicit solvent simulations using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm for long-range electrostatics using this precision model. Tests demonstrate both the performance of this implementation as well as its numerical stability for constant energy and constant temperature biomolecular MD as compared to a double precision CPU implementation and double and mixed single/double precision GPU implementations.

The structural unit model is used as a benchmark to evaluate the atomic structure description capacities of an emerging structural descriptor, the local environment representation, which itself is a refinement of the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptor. We show that the local environment representation encodes both the information of the structural unit model and additional information, such as distortion in the structural units and the arrangement of the structural units at the interface. The use of the local environment representation permits the use of a visualization tool known as SPRING to represent structural similarities between grain boundaries. With the SPRING representation, we produce objective evidence of a relationship between crystallography and atomic structure, at least for ½1 0 0 - symmetric tilt grain boundaries.},

  abstract = {Grain boundaries (GBs) influence a wide array of physical properties in polycrystalline materials and play an important role in governing microstructural evolution under extreme environments. While the importance of interfaces is well documented, their properties are among the least understood of all the defect types present in engineering material systems. This is due to the vast configurational space of interfaces, resulting in a diverse range of structures and properties. The complexity associated with GB structures is related to the different crystallographic degrees of freedom – the misorientation, the boundary-plane orientation and the relative translations between the adjoining crystals. These unique challenges can be addressed by leveraging highthroughput simulations of GB properties and developing machine learning algorithms grounded in the concepts of bicrystallography of interfaces. To demystify the relationships between crystallography and properties, the symmetry aspects of GBs are reviewed with an emphasis on boundary-plane orientations and disconnection line defects. To quantify structure-property relationships, recent advances in describing GB structures using the polyhedral unit model and the gaussian-based approximation of local atomic environments are discussed. Finally, examples of predicting GB structure-property relationships using machine learning techniques are summarized. As part of a special issue, the goal of this review article is to motivate machine learning strategies that are informed by bicrystallography and novel structural descriptors for developing reliable crystallographystructure-property relationships for grain boundaries.},

  abstract = {Clathrate hydrates and ice I are the most abundant crystals of water. The study of their nucleation, growth, and decomposition using molecular simulations requires an accurate and efficient algorithm that distinguishes water molecules that belong to each of these crystals and the liquid phase. Existing algorithms identify ice or clathrates, but not both. This poses a challenge for cases in which ice and hydrate coexist, such as in the synthesis of clathrates from ice and the formation of ice from clathrates during self-preservation of methane hydrates. Here we present an efficient algorithm for the identification of clathrate hydrates, hexagonal ice, cubic ice, and liquid water in molecular simulations. CHILL+ uses the number of staggered and eclipsed water–water bonds to identify water molecules in cubic ice, hexagonal ice, and clathrate hydrate. CHILL+ is an extension of CHILL (Moore et al. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2010, 12, 4124–4134), which identifies hexagonal and cubic ice but not clathrates. In addition to the identification of hydrates, CHILL+ significantly improves the detection of hexagonal ice up to its melting point. We validate the use of CHILL+ for the identification of stacking faults in ice and the nucleation and growth of clathrate hydrates. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that allows for the simultaneous identification of ice and clathrate hydrates, and it does so in a way that is competitive with respect to existing methods used to identify any of these crystals.},

We present three studies of how they are using notebooks to document and share exploratory data analyses. In the first, we analyzed over 1 million computational notebooks on GitHub, finding that one in four had no explanatory text but consisted entirely of visualizations or code. In a second study, we examined over 200 academic computational notebooks, finding that although the vast majority described methods, only a minority discussed reasoning or results. In a third study, we interviewed 15 academic data analysts, finding that most considered computational notebooks personal, exploratory, and messy. Importantly, they typically used other media to share analyses. These studies demonstrate a tension between exploration and explanation in constructing and sharing computational notebooks. We conclude with opportunities to encourage explanation in computational media without hindering exploration.},

To address this challenge, numerical methods, such as the shooting and linear finite-difference methods, have been utilized to quickly solve Schrödinger’s equation. In this technology report, we use the Python programming environment and the three-point finite-difference numerical method to find the solutions and plot the results (wave functions or probability densities) for a particle in an infinite, finite, double finite, harmonic, Morse, or Kronig–Penney finite potential energy well.

The algorithm is similar to SHAKE, which is one of the standard methods for performing such calculations. RATTLE calculates the positions and velocities at the next time from the positions and velocities at the present time step, without requiring information about the earlier history. Like SHAKE, it is based on the Verlet algorithm and retains the simplicity of using Cartesian coordinates for each of the atoms to describe the configuration of a molecule with internal constraints. RATTLE guarantees that the coordinates and velocities of the atoms in a molecule satisfy the internal constraints at each time step. RATTLE has two advantages over SHAKE. On computers of fixed precision, it is of higher precision than SHAKE. Since it deals directly with the velocities, it is easier to modify RATTLE for use with the recently developed constant temperature and constant pressure molecular dynamics methods and with the nonequilibrium molecular dynamics methods that make use of rescaling of the atomic velocities.},

At temperatures below Tk, the crystal would have a greater entropy than its liquid. Such a catastrophe is avoided through a glass transition of the liquid above Tk. Fecht and Johnson2 have shown that such a transition should occur for aluminium at 0.23 Tm. A similar entropy catastrophe can also arise at a temperature, TiS, above Tm. Above TiS, the crystalline solid is once again expected to have an entropy greater than that of the liquid. Cahn3 has considered the implications of this idea with respect to the superheating of a solid. Here we present an alternative evaluation of the two temperatures of instability, Tk and TiS, from experimentally measurable parameters. Results for alkali metals show that the Kauzmann-type entropy catastrophe occurs at about half the absolute melting temperature, whereas we find that the entropy catastrophe as described by Fecht and Johnson2 occurs at twice the absolute melting temperature. For most solids, vaporization will probably intervene before the entropy catastrophe temperature above the melting temperature is reached.},

Using the previously derived universal order parameter model of the crystal–melt transition (Iwamatsu M and Horii K 1996 J. Phys. Soc. Japan 65 2311), it is determined that the catastrophic homogeneous nucleation occurs at Tsuper ∼ 1.11 Tm, where Tm is the equilibrium melting point. This numerical estimation is consistent with the results of maximum-superheating experiments.},

  abstract = {The early stages of crystallization are not fully understood, a particularly challenging problem being crystallization from solution. The processes involved at an atomic level remain elusive to experiment. Furthermore, crystallization from solution has been thought to be inaccessible by atomistic computer simulations. This study demonstrates that crystallization from solution can in fact be simulated using the method of molecular dynamics for a model solute/solvent system consisting of atomic species characterized by the Lennard-Jones potential function. The model has been applied to look at the effects of varying supersaturation and of inclusion of a simple inhibitor in the system. The behavior of the model is in accord with experiment. In general, increasing supersaturation causes earlier onset of crystallization. Crystallization in highly supersaturated systems involves liquid-liquid phase separation followed by nucleation in the solute phase. The nucleation event in such systems does not appear to be influenced by the solvent. Inclusion of inhibitors retards the onset. Additionally, extensive solute clustering is observed. The crystallization model and variations on it, as well as step by step extension to realistic systems, should enable further testing and development of theory of crystal nucleation and growth and provide insights of technological importance.},

Colloidal suspensions show a phase behavior that is analogous to atomic or molecular systems and serve accordingly as ideal model systems for studying crystal nucleation with an accuracy and depth on a microscopic scale that is hard to reach for atomic or molecular systems. Due to the mesoscopic size of colloidal particles they can be studied in detail on the single-particle level and their dynamics is strongly slowed down in comparison with atomic or molecular systems, such that the formation of a crystal nucleus can be followed in detail. In this review, recent progress in the study of homogeneous and heterogeneous crystal nucleation in colloids and the controlled growth of crystalline colloidal structures is reviewed. All this work has resulted in unprecedented insights into the early stage of nucleation and it is also relevant for a deeper understanding of soft matter materials in general as well as for possible applications based on colloidal suspensions.},

We report the two-dimensional dense packing patterns of bending and assembled rods, which are non-convexly deformed from simple objects and modeled as entangled particles. Monte Carlo simulations and further analytical constructions are carried out to explore possible densely packed structures. Two typical densely packed structures of C-bending rods are found, and their packing densities are identified as being functions of the aspect ratio and central angle. Six shapes of assembled rods, representing the combined deformations of rods, are employed in simulations with the packing structures classified into three types. The dense packing density of each packing pattern is derived as a function of different shape parameters. In contrast with the case of disordered packings, both the shape and order are verified to affect the packing density.},

  abstract = {Binary sphere packings with a density greater than that of phase-separated face-centered cubic (fcc) packings are important structural candidates for the self-assembly of mixtures of stabilized, hard, spherical particles. Details are presented of an A3B binary hard sphere packing obtained by simulated annealing in an isopointal set 62cd/c. The structure has a higher density than all known others when the sphere radius ratio rA/rB is between 0.619 and 0.659786. This extends the known range over which compound binary sphere packings can exceed the density of phase-separated fcc packing. Previously, no packings were known to exceed this mark between a radius ratio of 0.62 and 1.0. The structure of interest has a peak density of 0.747857, which occurs at a radius ratio of 0.647989. A related dense packing is also discussed, which has a peak density of 0.7573 at a size ratio of 0.5147. This latter structure is the densest known noninterstitial compound packing when the mixture has three small spheres for every large sphere, at any size ratio. Both structures are likely candidates for stability in binary hard sphere phase diagrams at this composition, but neither has so far been observed experimentally.},

Kinetic coefficient, one of the important parameters that controls solidification growth morphology, is calculated using free solidification method employing two different interatomic potentials. Compared to pure metals, the kinetic coefficients of the ordered systems are smaller by at least an order of magnitude. For the first time, we show here that the growth kinetics of ordered Ni3Al is very sluggish compared to that of the disordered system. The difference is attributed to the diffusion limited growth in the ordered systems vis-á-vis the interface limited growth in their counterpart. Theoretical models by Broughton-Gilmer-Jackson and Wilson-Frenkel are employed to corroborate the identified growth mechanisms. The extent of disorder trapped increases with increasing interface velocity.},

  abstract = {We identify putatively maximally dense packings of tangent-sphere trimers with fixed bond angles (\$\textbackslash{}theta = \textbackslash{}theta\_0\$) using a novel method, and contrast them to the disordered jammed states they form under quasistatic and dynamic athermal compression. Incommensurability of \$\textbackslash{}theta\_0\$ with 3D close-packing does not by itself inhibit formation of dense 3D crystals; all \$\textbackslash{}theta\_0\$ allow formation of crystals with \$\textbackslash{}phi\_\{max\}(\textbackslash{}theta\_0) {$>$} 0.97\textbackslash{}phi\_\{cp\}\$. Trimers are always able to arrange into periodic structures composed of close-packed bilayers or trilayers of triangular-lattice planes, separated by ``gap layers'' that accomodate the incommensurability. All systems have \$\textbackslash{}phi\_J\$ significantly below the monomeric value, indicating that trimers' quenched bond-length and bond-angle constraints always act to promote jamming. \$\textbackslash{}phi\_J\$ varies strongly with \$\textbackslash{}theta\_0\$; straight (\$\textbackslash{}theta\_0 = 0\$) trimers minimize \$\textbackslash{}phi\_J\$ while closed (\$\textbackslash{}theta\_0 = 120\^\textbackslash{}circ\$) trimers maximize it. Marginally jammed states of trimers with lower \$\textbackslash{}phi\_J(\textbackslash{}theta\_0)\$ exhibit quantifiably greater disorder, and the lower \$\textbackslash{}phi\_J\$ for small \$\textbackslash{}theta\_0\$ is apparently caused by trimers' decreasing effective configurational freedom as they approach linearity.},

  abstract = {The melting transition of two-dimensional systems is a fundamental problem in condensed matter and statistical physics that has advanced significantly through the application of computational resources and algorithms. Two-dimensional systems present the opportunity for novel phases and phase transition scenarios not observed in 3D systems, but these phases depend sensitively on the system and, thus, predicting how any given 2D system will behave remains a challenge. Here, we report a comprehensive simulation study of the phase behavior near the melting transition of all hard regular polygons with 3≤n≤14 vertices using massively parallel Monte Carlo simulations of up to 1×106 particles. By investigating this family of shapes, we show that the melting transition depends upon both particle shape and symmetry considerations, which together can predict which of three different melting scenarios will occur for a given n. We show that systems of polygons with as few as seven edges behave like hard disks; they melt continuously from a solid to a hexatic fluid and then undergo a first-order transition from the hexatic phase to the isotropic fluid phase. We show that this behavior, which holds for all 7≤n≤14, arises from weak entropic forces among the particles. Strong directional entropic forces align polygons with fewer than seven edges and impose local order in the fluid. These forces can enhance or suppress the discontinuous character of the transition depending on whether the local order in the fluid is compatible with the local order in the solid. As a result, systems of triangles, squares, and hexagons exhibit a Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) predicted continuous transition between isotropic fluid and triatic, tetratic, and hexatic phases, respectively, and a continuous transition from the appropriate x-atic to the solid. In particular, we find that systems of hexagons display continuous two-step KTHNY melting. In contrast, due to symmetry incompatibility between the ordered fluid and solid, systems of pentagons and plane-filling fourfold pentilles display a one-step first-order melting of the solid to the isotropic fluid with no intermediate phase.},

Not all high-dimensional data exhibit these characteristics because many data sets have correlations, which led to the notion of intrinsic dimensionality. Intrinsic dimensionality describes the local behavior of data on a low-dimensional manifold within the higher dimensional space.We discuss this effect, and describe a surprisingly simple approach modification that allows us to reduce local intrinsic dimensionality of individual points. While this unlikely will be able to “cure” all problems associated with high dimensionality, we show the theoretical impact on idealized distributions and how to practically incorporate it into new, more robust, algorithms. To demonstrate the effect of this adjustment, we introduce the novel Intrinsic Stochastic Outlier Score (ISOS), and we propose modifications of the popular t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualization technique for intrinsic dimensionality, intrinsic t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (it-SNE).},

Patterns of gene expression can be used to characterize and classify neuronal types. It is challenging, however, to generate taxonomies that fulfill the essential criteria of being comprehensive, harmonizing with conventional classification schemes, and lacking superfluous subdivisions of genuine types. To address these challenges, we used massively parallel single-cell RNA profiling and optimized computational methods on a heterogeneous class of neurons, mouse retinal bipolar cells (BCs). From a population of ∼25,000 BCs, we derived a molecular classification that identified 15 types, including all types observed previously and two novel types, one of which has a~non-canonical morphology and position. We validated the classification scheme and identified dozens of novel markers using methods that match molecular expression to cell morphology. This work provides a systematic methodology for achieving comprehensive molecular classification of neurons, identifies novel neuronal types, and uncovers transcriptional differences that distinguish types within a class.},

  abstract = {The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex set that contains the points. This article presents a practical convex hull algorithm that combines the two-dimensional Quickhull Algorithm with the general-dimension Beneath-Beyond Algorithm. It is similar to the randomized, incremental algorithms for convex hull and Delaunay triangulation. We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm runs faster when the input contains nonextreme points and that it uses less memory. Computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets are well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating-point arithmetic, this assumption can lead to serious errors. We briefly describe a solution to this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or four dimensions. The output is a set of “thick ” facets that contain all possible exact convex hulls of the input. A variation is effective in five or more dimensions.},

Given n sets, this procedure permits their reduction to n − 1 mutually exclusive sets by considering the union of all possible n(n − 1)/2 pairs and selecting a union having a maximal value for the functional relation, or objective function, that reflects the criterion chosen by the investigator. By repeating this process until only one group remains, the complete hierarchical structure and a quantitative estimate of the loss associated with each stage in the grouping can be obtained.

Predefined tests suites for sequences of uniform random numbers over the interval (0, 1) and for bit sequences are available. Tools are also offered to perform systematic studies of the interaction between a specific test and the structure of the point sets produced by a given family of RNGs. That is, for a given kind of test and a given class of RNGs, to determine how large should be the sample size of the test, as a function of the generator's period length, before the generator starts to fail the test systematically. Finally, the library provides various types of generators implemented in generic form, as well as many specific generators proposed in the literature or found in widely used software. The tests can be applied to instances of the generators predefined in the library, or to user-defined generators, or to streams of random numbers produced by any kind of device or stored in files. Besides introducing TestU01, the article provides a survey and a classification of statistical tests for RNGs. It also applies batteries of tests to a long list of widely used RNGs.},

  abstract = {Often, in a regression situation with many variables, a sequence of submodels is generated containing fewer variables by using such methods as stepwise addition or deletion of variables, or 'best subsets'. The question is which of this sequence of submodels is 'best', and how can submodel performance be evaluated. This was explored in Breiman (1988) for a fixed X-design. This is a sequel exploring the case of random X-designs. Analytical results are difficult, if not impossible. This study involved an extensive simulation. The basis of the study is the theoretical definition of prediction error (PE) as the expected squared error produced by applying a prediction equation to the distributional universe of (y, x) values. This definition is used throughout to compare various submodels. There can be startling differences between the x-fixed and x-random situations and different PE estimates are appropriate. Non-resampling estimates such as CP, adjusted R2, etc. turn out to be highly biased methods for submodel selection. The two best methods are cross-validation and bootstrap. One surprise is that 5 fold cross-validation (leave out 20\% of the data) is better at submodel selection and evaluation than leave-one-out cross-validation. There are a number of other surprises. /// Dans l'analyse de problèmes de régression à plusieurs variables (indépendantes), on produit souvent une série de sous-modèles constitués d'un sous-ensemble des variables par des méthodes telles que l'addition par étape, le retrait par étape et la méthode du meilleur sous-ensemble. Le problème est de déterminer lequel de ces sous-modèles est le meilleur et d'évaluer sa performance. Ce problème fut exploré dans Breiman (1988) pour le cas d'une matrice X fixe. Dans ce qui suit on considère le cas où la matrice X est aléatoire. La détermination de résultats analytiques est difficile, sinon impossible. Notre étude a utilisé des simulations de grande envergure. Elle se base sur la définition théorique de l'erreur de prédiction (EP) comme étant l'espérance du carré de l'erreur produite en applicant une équation de prédiction à l'univers distributional des valeurs (y, x). La définition est utilisée dans toute l'étude à fin de comparer divers sous-modèles. Il y a une différence étonnante entre le cas où la matrice X est fixée et celui où elle est aléatoire. Différents estimateurs de la EP sont à propos. Les estimateurs n'utilisant pas de ré-échantillonage, tels que le Cp et le R2 ajusté, produisent des méthodes de sélection ayant grand biais. Les deux meilleures méthodes sont la validation croisée et l'autoamorçage. Une surprise est que la validation croisée quintuple est meilleure que la validation croisée tous sauf un.

On the other hand, cross-validation is no more or less a form of bias than simpler strategies, and applying it appropriately ultimately depends in the same way on prior knowledge. In fact, cross-validation may be seen as a way of applying partial information about the applicability of alternative classification strategies.},

Rather, they are characterised by their flexibility, which is the result of the interaction and collective motion of their constituent atoms. This conformational diversity has a significant impact on their physicochemical and biological properties. Among these are their structural stability, the transport of ions through the M2 channel, drug resistance, macromolecular docking, binding energy, and rational epitope design. To assess these properties and to calculate the associated thermodynamical observables, the conformational space must be efficiently sampled and the dynamic of the constituent atoms must be simulated. This paper presents algorithms and techniques that address the abovementioned issues. To this end, a computational review of molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo simulations, Langevin dynamics, and free energy calculation is presented. The exposition is made from first principles to promote a better understanding of the potentialities, limitations, applications, and interrelations of these computational methods.},

Here, we present the first compelling atomic structural model for metallic glasses. This structural model is based on a new sphere-packing scheme-the dense packing of atomic clusters. Random positioning of solvent atoms and medium-range atomic order of solute atoms are combined to reproduce diffraction data successfully over radial distances up to approximately 1 nm. Although metallic glasses can have any number of chemically distinct solute species, this model shows that they contain no more than three topologically distinct solutes and that these solutes have specific and predictable sizes relative to the solvent atoms. Finally, this model includes defects that provide richness to the structural description of metallic glasses. The model accurately predicts the number of solute atoms in the first coordination shell of a typical solvent atom, and provides a remarkable ability to predict metallic-glass compositions accurately for a wide range of simple and complex alloys.},

  abstract = {This manuscript explores the influence of atomic structure on glass forming ability and thermal stability in binary metallic glasses. A critical assessment gives literature data for 628 alloys from 175 binary glass systems. The atomic structure is quantified for each alloy using the efficient cluster packing model. Comparison of atomic structure with amorphous thickness and thermal stability gives the following major results. Binary glasses show a strong preference for discrete solute to solvent atomic radius ratios R*, which give efficient local atomic packing of 15 possible R* values, only five are common and only four represent the most stable glasses. The most stable vinary glasses are also typically solute rich, with enough solute atoms to fill all the solute sites and roughly one-third of the solvent sites. This suggests that antisite defects, where solutes occupy solvent atom sites, are important in the glass forming ability of the most stable glasses. This stabilising effect results from an increase in the number of more stable solute-solvent bonds in solute rich glasses. Solute rich glasses also enable efficient global atomic packing. Together, these structural constraints represent only a narrow range of topologies and thus give a useful predictive tool for the exploration and discovery of new binary bulk metallic glasses (BMGs).},

Of the numerous approaches aimed at solving the glass transition problem, the Random First-Order Theory (RFOT) is the most prominent. However, the existence of the underlying thermodynamic phase transition envisioned by RFOT remains debatable, since its key microscopic predictions concerning the growth of amorphous order and the nature of dynamic correlations lack experimental verification. Here, by using holographic optical tweezers, we freeze a wall of particles in an equilibrium configuration of a 2D colloidal glass-forming liquid and provide direct evidence for growing amorphous order in the form of a static point-to-set length. Most remarkably, we uncover the non-monotonic dependence of dynamic correlations on area fraction and show that this non-monotonicity follows directly from the change in morphology of cooperatively rearranging regions, as predicted by RFOT. Our findings suggest that the glass transition has a thermodynamic origin.},

  abstract = {We report a numerical calculation of the total number of disordered jammed configurations \$\textbackslash{}Omega\$ of \$N\$ repulsive, three-dimensional spheres in a fixed volume \$V\$. To make these calculations tractable, we increase the computational efficiency of the approach of Xu et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 245502 (2011)) and Asenjo et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 098002 (2014)) and we extend the method to allow computation of the granular entropy as a function of pressure. The approach that we use computes the granular entropy by sampling the absolute volume of basins of attraction of the stable packings in the potential energy landscape. We find a surprisingly strong correlation between the pressure of a configuration and the volume of its basin of attraction in the potential energy landscape. This relation is well described by a power law. Our methodology to compute the number of stable packings should be applicable to a wide range of other enumeration problems that aims to find the extrema of a scalar cost function that depends on many degrees of freedom.},

We address this question using nanoscale films of methanol and ethanol supercooled liquid solutions of varying composition (0-100\% methanol) at temperatures near their glass transition, Tg. The permeation of Kr through these films is used to determine the diffusivities of the supercooled liquid mixtures. We find that the temperature-dependent diffusivities of the mixtures are well-fit by a Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman equation, indicating that the mixtures exhibit fragile behavior at temperatures just above their Tg. Further, for a given temperature, the composition-dependent diffusivity is well-fit by a Vignes-type equation, that is, the diffusivity of any mixture can be predicted using an exponential weighting of the pure methanol and ethanol diffusivities. These results show that deeply supercooled liquid mixtures can be used to provide valuable},

  abstract = {This paper addresses an important materials engineering question: How can one identify the complete space (or as much of it as possible) of microstructures that are theoretically predicted to yield the desired combination of properties demanded by a selected application? We present a problem involving design of magnetoelastic Fe-Ga alloy microstructure for enhanced elastic, plastic and magnetostrictive properties. While theoretical models for computing properties given the microstructure are known for this alloy, inversion of these relationships to obtain microstructures that lead to desired properties is challenging, primarily due to the high dimensionality of microstructure space, multi-objective design requirement and non-uniqueness of solutions. These challenges render traditional search-based optimization methods incompetent in terms of both searching efficiency and result optimality. In this paper, a route to address these challenges using a machine learning methodology is proposed. A systematic framework consisting of random data generation, feature selection and classification algorithms is developed. Experiments with five design problems that involve identification of microstructures that satisfy both linear and nonlinear property constraints show that our framework outperforms traditional optimization methods with the average running time reduced by as much as 80\% and with optimality that would not be achieved otherwise.},

An Einstein formulation of rotational motion is presented, which supplements the commonly used Debye model. The latter is shown to break down at supercooled temperatures as the mechanism of molecular reorientation changes from small random steps to large infrequent orientational jumps. We find that the model system exhibits non-Gaussian behavior in translational and rotational motion, which strengthens upon supercooling. Examination of particle mobility reveals spatially heterogeneous dynamics in translation and rotation, with a strong spatial correlation between translationally and rotationally mobile particles. Application of the Einstein formalism to the analysis of translation-rotation decoupling results in a trend opposite to that seen in conventional approaches based on the Debye formalism, namely, an enhancement in the effective rate of rotational motion relative to translation upon supercooling.},

  abstract = {Self-diffusion coefficients for the low molecular weight glass former o-terphenyl have been measured near Tg by isothermally desorbing thin film bilayers of deuterio and protio o-terphenyl in a vacuum chamber. We observe translational diffusion that is about 100 times faster at Tg + 3 K than the Stokes-Einstein prediction. Predictions from random first order transition theory and a dynamic facilitation approach are in reasonable agreement with our results; in these approaches, enhanced translational diffusion is associated with spatially heterogeneous dynamics. Self-diffusion controls crystallization in o-terphenyl for most of the supercooled liquid regime, but at temperatures below Tg + 10 K, the reported crystallization rate increases suddenly while the self-diffusion coefficient does not. This work and previous work on trisnaphthylbenzene both find a self-diffusion-controlled crystal growth regime and an enhancement in self-diffusion near Tg, suggesting that these phenomena are general characteristics of fragile low molecular weight glass formers. We discuss the width of the relaxation time distributions of o-terphenyl and trisnaphthylbenzene as they relate to the observation of enhanced translational diffusion.},

These new steels showed interesting physical, magnetic, and mechanical properties, along with high thermal stability.

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to study the structure and dynamical heterogeneity in the liquid and glass states of Al using a frequently employed embedded atom potential. While the pair correlation function of the glass and liquid states displays only minor differences, the icosahedral short-range order (ISRO) and the dynamics of the two states are very different. The ISRO is much stronger in the glass than in the liquid. It is also found that both the most mobile and the most immobile atoms in the glass state tend to form clusters, and the clusters formed by the immobile atoms are more compact. In order to investigate the local environment of each atom in the liquid and glass states, a local density is defined to characterize the local atomic packing. There is a strong correlation between the local packing density and the mobility of the atoms. These results indicate that dynamical heterogeneity in glasses is directly correlated to the local structure. We also analyze the diffusion mechanisms of atoms in the liquid and glass states. It is found that for the mobile atoms in the glass state, initially they are confined in the cages formed by their nearest neighbors and vibrating. On the time scale of β relaxation, the mobile atoms try to break up the cage confinement and hop into new cages. In the supercooled liquid states, however, atoms continuously diffuse. Furthermore, it is found that on the time scale of β relaxation, some of the mobile atoms in the glass state cooperatively hop, which is facilitated by the stringlike cluster structures. On the longer time scale, it is found that a certain fraction of atoms can simultaneously hop, although they are not nearest neighbors. Further analysis shows that these hopping atoms form big and more compact clusters than the characterized most mobile atoms. The cooperative rearrangement of these big compact clusters might facilitate the simultaneous hopping of atoms in the glass states on the long time scale.},

In Edwards' ensemble-one of the very few generalizations of standard statistical mechanics-thermodynamic quantities are computed as flat averages over configurations in which the grains are static or jammed, leading to a natural definition of configurational temperature. But the approach is not justified from first principles and hence, in the absence of explicit tests of its validity, has not been widely accepted. Here we report a numerical experiment involving a realistic model of slowly sheared granular matter; our results strongly support the thermodynamic description. Considering particles of different sizes in a slowly sheared dense granular system, we extract an effective temperature from a relation connecting their diffusivity and mobility. We then perform an explicit computation to show that the effective temperature measured from this relation coincides with the Edwards configurational temperature. Our approach, which is specifically conceived to be reproducible in the laboratory, may thus render the Edwards temperature accessible to experiments.},

By determining the temperature dependence of the interface velocity, an accurate estimate of the melting temperature is provided. The value k=0.0025 m/s/K for the kinetic growth coefficient is found. This value is about two orders of magnitude smaller than that found in recent simulation studies of one-component metals.

We provide decisive experimental evidence that this transition is a critical phenomenon, with increasingly collective and heterogeneous rearrangements occurring at length scales much smaller than the grain diameter, presumably reflecting the contact force network fluctuations. Dynamical correlation time and length scales soar on both sides of the transition, as the volume fraction varies over a remarkably tiny range (dphi/phi 10\^-3). We characterize the motion of individual grains, which becomes super-diffusive at the jamming transition phi\_J, signaling long-ranged temporal correlations. Correspondingly, the system exhibits long-ranged four-point dynamical correlations in space that obey critical scaling at the transition density},

This master curve can be fitted well by a power-law for almost three decades in rescaled time and the scaling time, or relaxation time, has a power-law dependence on temperature. Thus the predictions of mode-coupling-theory on the existence of a von Schweidler law are found to hold for this system; moreover, the exponents in these two power-laws are very close to satisfying the exponent relationship predicted by the mode-coupling-theory. At low temperatures, the diffusion constants also show a power-law behavior with the same critical temperature. However, the exponent for diffusion differs from that of the relaxation time, a result that is in disagreement with the theory.},

This method is in fact fully implicit and of very high order, ensuring a high stability of the time propagation. Moreover, it has the following advantages: it provides a scheme for an adaptive time step and it is particularly well suited to parallel computing. We discuss the performance of the present approach and compare it to already existing ones. In the case of linearly polarized fields, most of our results are in good agreement with those obtained with other approaches. In the case of circularly polarized fields, we compare our results with those obtained by, so far, the only existing method which is based on the single state Floquet approximation. Finally, and for the sake of illustration, we treat the case of the interaction of atomic hydrogen with a strong pulsed electromagnetic field whose polarization depends on time.},

  abstract = {When the temperature of a supercooled liquid is brought below approximately  two-thirds of the normal freezing point, a rather sudden drop in the specific heat  and the thermal expansion coefficient is observed. It is widely agreed that this  “glass transformation” is caused by a relaxation effect, through which some process  in the amorphous material occurs t,oo slowly at low temperatures to permit thermodynamic  equilibrium to be established in all degrees of freedom. It is shown that  the molecular movements involved in the relaxation process must resemble closely  the movements in viscous flow and dielectric relaxation. Movements of this type  permit the liquid structure to change following temperature and pressure changes.  Thus it is the contribution of changing liquid structure to the thermodynamic  properties which is absent at low temperatures and results in the drop in specific  heat and coefficient of expansion.  Accordingly vitrification can always be avoided in principle by making measuremcnts  sufficiently slowly. With a view to understanding the “true” thermodynamics  of supercooled liquids as observed in such slow experiments the trends in  the observed thermodynamic properties of liquids above the glass-transformation temperature are examined. These trends seem to indicate that the entropies and  enthalpies, but not the free energies, of many non-vitreous liquids would become  less than those of the corresponding crystalline phases at temperatures well above  the absolute zero. This paradoxical result would seem to imply that there is a  temperature below which a non-vitreous liquid cannot exist, owing to spontaneous  crystallization. There are good theoretical reasons for believing in the existence  of such a “pseudocritical temperature.”},

  abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently--those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90\% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

The length r is chosen so as to maximize the resolution of the kinetic structure. This analysis produces a natural measure of cooperativity.

Defects in two-dimensional monolayer molybdenum disulphide may be responsible for large variation of electric and optical properties. Here we present a comprehensive joint experiment-theory investigation of point defects in monolayer molybdenum disulphide prepared by mechanical exfoliation, physical and chemical vapour deposition. Defect species are systematically identified and their concentrations determined by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, and also studied by ab-initio calculation. Defect density up to 3.5 × 10(13) cm(-2) is found and the dominant category of defects changes from sulphur vacancy in mechanical exfoliation and chemical vapour deposition samples to molybdenum antisite in physical vapour deposition samples. Influence of defects on electronic structure and charge-carrier mobility are predicted by calculation and observed by electric transport measurement. In light of these results, the growth of ultra-high-quality monolayer molybdenum disulphide appears a primary task for the community pursuing high-performance electronic devices.},

  abstract = {Differently doped GaAs crystals were irradiated at 4 K with 0.4- and 2.2-MeV electrons and were investigated by optical absorption spectroscopy with special emphasis on the magnetic circular dichroism of the optical absorption (MCDA). The MCDA yields very characteristic fingerprints of two V-Ga-related defects and of the different arsenic antisites AS(Ga)-X(1), AS(Ga)-X(2), and EL2. Using these fingerprints the production and the thermally activated reactions of these defects were systematically investigated up to the final annealing at T-a approximate to 850 K. We show that both sublattices are involved in the defect production even at the lowest electron energies and discuss the importance of replacement collisions. Many antisite defects survive the well-known annealing stages (I to III) of Frenkel pairs. EL2 defects seem to be the most stable antisite configuration and are also observed in n-type GaAs that contained no EL2 defects before irradiation. A comparison of the spectra obtained after low-temperature irradiations and annealing with spectra obtained after corresponding high-temperature irradiations shows remarkable similarities. All kinds of As-Ga- related complexes are usually present simultaneously and we deduce a consistent picture of the visibility of their paramagnetic charge states as a function of doping, irradiation dose, and annealing temperature.

In this paper, we investigate the random packing structure of two-dimensional (2D) snowmen via wax-snowman packing experiments and Brownian dynamics simulations. Both experiments and simulations reveal that neighboring snowmen have a strong short-range orientational correlation and consequently locally form particular conformations. A chiral conformation is dominant for high area fractions near the jamming condition (φ{$>$}0.8), and the proportion of the chiral conformation increases with γ. We also found that the attractive interaction does not have a significant impact on the results. The geometry of chirally ordered snowmen causes a mismatch with 2D crystalline symmetries and thus inhibits the development of long-range spatial order, despite the strong orientational correlation between neighbors.},

  doi = {10.1023/A:1007516718048},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the magnitude of the solubility advantage for amorphous pharmaceutical materials when compared to their crystalline counterparts. METHODS: The thermal properties of several drugs in their amorphous and crystalline states were determined using differential scanning calorimetry. From these properties the solubility advantage for the amorphous form was predicted as a function of temperature using a simple thermodynamic analysis. These predictions were compared to the results of experimental measurements of the aqueous solubilities of the amorphous and crystalline forms of the drugs at several temperatures. RESULTS: By treating each amorphous drug as either an equilibrium supercooled liquid or a pseudo-equilibrium glass, the solubility advantage compared to the most stable crystalline form was predicted to be between 10 and 1,600 fold. The measured solubility advantage was usually considerably less than this, and for one compound studied in detail its temperature dependence was also less than predicted. It was calculated that even for partially amorphous materials the apparent solubility enhancement (theoretical or measured) is likely to influence in-vitro and in-vivo dissolution behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Amorphous pharmaceuticals are markedly more soluble than their crystalline counterparts, however, their experimental solubility advantage is typically less than that predicted from simple thermodynamic considerations. This appears to be the result of difficulties in determining the solubility of amorphous materials under true equilibrium conditions. Simple thermodynamic predictions can provide a useful indication of the theoretical maximum solubility advantage for amorphous pharmaceuticals, which directly reflects the driving force for their initial dissolution.},

Starting from the thermodynamics, the route towards the dynamics is elucidated. A key step in this endeavor is the concept of metabasins. The relevant energy scales of the PEL can be characterized. Based on the simulation results for some glass-forming systems one can formulate a relevant model system (ideal Gaussian glass-former) which can be treated analytically. The macroscopic transport can be related to the microscopic hopping processes, using either the strong relation between energy (thermodynamics) and waiting times (dynamics) or, alternatively, the concepts of the continuous-time random walk. The relation to the geometric properties of the PEL is stressed. The emergence of length scales within the PEL approach as well as the nature of finite-size effects is discussed. Furthermore, the PEL view is compared to other approaches describing the glass transition.},

  abstract = {We propose an approach for summarizing the output of long simulations of complex systems, affording a rapid overview arid interpretation. First, multidimensional scaling techniques are used in conjunction with dimension reduction methods to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the configuration space explored by the system. A nonparametric estimate of the density of states in this subspace is then obtained using kernel methods. The free energy surface is calculated from that density, and the configurations produced in the simulation are then clustered according to the topography of that surface, such that all configurations belonging to one local free energy minimum form one class. This topographical cluster analysis is performed using basin spanning trees which we introduce as subgraphs of Delaunay triangulations. Free energy surfaces obtained in dimensions lower than four can be visualized directly using iso-contours and -surfaces. Basin spanning trees also afford a glimpse of higher-dimensional topographies. The procedure is illustrated using molecular dynamics simulations on the reversible folding of peptide analoga. Finally, we emphasize the intimate relation of density estimation techniques to modern enhanced sampling algorithms. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

Interestingly, this decoupling has been found to occur at temperatures ∼50–100 K above the glass transition temperatures of the above melt at various anion concentrations (f LiBr ). The decoupling is reflected via the following fractional viscosity dependence (η) of the measured average solvation and rotation times (⟨τ s ⟩ and ⟨τ r ⟩, respectively): ⟨τ x ⟩ ∝ (η/T) p (x being solvation or rotation), with p covering the range, 0.20 {$<$} p {$<$} 0.70. Although this is very similar to what is known for deeply supercooled liquids, it is very surprising because of the temperature range at which the above decoupling occurs for these molten mixtures. The kinship to the supercooled liquids is further exhibited via p which is always larger for ⟨τ r ⟩ than for ⟨τ s ⟩, indicating a sort of translation-rotation decoupling. Multiple probes have been used in steady state fluorescencemeasurements to explore the extent of static heterogeneity. Estimated experimental dynamic Stokes shift for coumarin 153 in these mixtures lies in the range, 1000 {$<$} Δν t /cm−1 {$<$} 1700, and is in semi-quantitative agreement with predictions from our semi-molecular theory. The participation of the fluctuating density modes at various length-scales to the observed solvation times has also been investigated.},

  abstract = {Amorphous glassy materials of diverse nature-concentrated emulsions, granular materials, pastes, molecular glasses-display complex flow properties, intermediate between solid and liquid, which are at the root of their use in many applications. A general feature of such systems, well documented yet not really understood, is the strongly nonlinear nature of the flow rule relating stresses and strain rates. Here we use a microfluidic velocimetry technique to characterize the flow of thin layers of concentrated emulsions, confined in gaps of different thicknesses by surfaces of different roughnesses. We find evidence for finite-size effects in the flow behaviour and the absence of an intrinsic local flow rule. In contrast to the classical nonlinearities of the rheological behaviour of amorphous materials, we show that a rather simple non-local flow rule can account for all the velocity profiles. This non-locality of the dynamics is quantified by a length, characteristic of cooperativity within the flow at these scales, that is unobservable in the liquid state (lower emulsion concentrations) and that increases with concentration in the jammed state. Beyond its practical importance for applications involving thin layers (for example, coatings), these non-locality and cooperativity effects have parallels in the behaviour of other glassy, jammed and granular systems, suggesting a possible fundamental universality.},

  abstract = {Glassy alloys (metallic glasses) are currently the focus of intense research in the international metals community. Setting aside elevated-temperature applications, these amorphous metals have exciting potential for structural applications. When metallic glasses were first widely studied in the 1960s, the alloy compositions then known to be quenchable into the glassy state from the liquid required high cooling rates on the order of 10\^6 K s−1 and were consequently restricted to thin sections. The current interest in metallic glasses has its origin mainly in the increasing range of compositions that can now be cast into glasses at much lower cooling rates, permitting minimum sections of 1 mm to 1 cm or even larger. These bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) are the focus of the articles in this issue of MRS Bulletin. Our goal is to illustrate the major materials issues for BMGs, from processing to structures to properties and from the fundamental science of glasses to viable industrial applications. We hope that the articles, in providing a snapshot of a rapidly moving field, show why BMGs are attracting such intense interest and serve to highlight some challenging issues awaiting resolution.},

  abstract = {The fire season of 2007 was particularly devastating for Greece, achieving the new all-time record of estimated burnt area (225,734. ha) since 1980. The season was remarkably severe in Peloponnese Peninsula, in southern continental Greece, being considered the most extreme natural disaster in the recent history of Greece. Moreover during the hydrological year of 2007, Peloponnese was struck by a severe winter drought that corresponds to the second lowest annual accumulated value since 1951. However, the subsequent spring was very wet partially attenuating the effect of the previous drought. Additionally, the region was stricken by three heat heaves during summer, being the number of hot nights especially noticeable, surpassing more than 35 nights over the Southern Greece. Here we show that the central and Northern sector of Peloponnese Peninsula become the most susceptible to wildfires due to the combined effect of the two extreme meteorological events, drought and heatwaves which was confirmed by the location of the main burnt areas of 2007 fire season. Additionally, the analysis showed that during the extreme days of fire activity in 2007, strong northerly advection of very hot and dry air over the region, favored fire occurrence. The study attempts to bring new light to the synergistic effect between fuel availability and weather conditions that created extraordinary conditions for fire propagation. We focused on the largest burnt areas and the respective NDVI behavior is assessed throughout the pre fire periods. We found that vegetation dynamics are related to the extreme climatic events that occurred in these periods. Moreover, our results confirm that the higher fire incidence in areas with higher vegetation activity and density seems to indicate that the large burnt areas of 2007 fires season in Peloponnese Peninsula appear to be more sensitive to fuel availability and vegetation density than to vegetation dryness.},

The natural fit between machine learning and pharmaceutical research leads to the common utilization of learning algorithms to construct quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR). Until recently, the application of machine learning methods is primarily the domain of specialists in the artificial intelligence or statistics fields. Early machine learning software requires an intimate knowledge of the algorithms and a familiarity with specialized programming languages, such as Prolog or Lisp. The availability of easily accessible, high-quality software has led to the widespread adoption of machine learning among computational chemists. Although modern machine learning techniques require minimal parameter adjustment to achieve reasonable results, it is inappropriate to treat these techniques as black boxes. As with other QSAR techniques, model quality and applicability must be judiciously assessed.},

  abstract = {Zeaxanthin-dependent nonphotochemical fluorescence quenching is a light-induced activity in plants that apparently protects against the potentially damaging effects of excess light. We report a dark-induced nonphotochemical quenching in thylakoids of Lactuca sativa L. cv. Romaine mediated by ATP. This effect is due to low lumen pH from hydrolysis-dependent proton pumping and hence required an active ATPase. The induction was optimal at 0.3 mM ATP, a physiological concentration, and occurred under conditions of little or no reverse electron flow. The properties of ATP-induced quenching were in all respects examined similar to light-induced quenching, including antimycin inhibition of quenching induction but not delta pH. We conclude that zeaxanthin-dependent quenching depends directly on lumen pH and that the role of light is indirect. Although it is known that zeaxanthin and low lumen pH are insufficient for quenching to occur, the results apparently exclude the redox state of an electron-transport carrier or formation of light-induced carotenoid triplets as a further requirement. We propose that a slow pH-dependent conformational change together with zeaxanthin cause static quenching in the pigment bed; possibly antimycin inhibits this change. Furthermore, we suggest from the ability of ATP to sustain quenching in the dark for extended periods that persistent or slowly reversible zeaxanthin quenching often observed in vivo may be due to sustained delta pH from ATP hydrolysis.},

  abstract = {Using a literature compilation of melting point and fusion enthalpy data from over 700 organic compounds it is shown that the entropy of fusion, Delta S-f, is dependent upon the enthalpy of fusion, Delta H-f. 'Flexible' molecules (those that are potentially multi-conformational tend to yield higher values of Delta S-f for a given Delta H-f, than do 'rigid' ones. The overall dependency is roughly linear and gives a positive intercept on the entropy axis. This is identified with Delta S-to, the entropy gained from onset of translational and orientational freedom on melting. The enthalpy dependent component, Delta S-h, is considered to arise by analogy with entropy-enthalpy compensation in ligand binding processes. Because of the way the Delta H-f distribution is truncated in typical 'random' selections of chemical compounds, dependency inevitably leads to kurtosis of the Delta S-f value distribution and this is augmented by kurtosis in Delta H-f and molecular weight. These are the main reasons for the often observed 'constancy' of Delta S-f for 'rigid' molecules which is termed Walden's Rule. This rule has therefore no general validity. 'Flexible' molecules usually possess additional entropy, Delta Sc, from the release of conformational disorder in the melt. Their relative position on the Delta S-f/Delta H-f plot can indicate the magnitude and extent of such disorder. For instance the situation of n-alkanes suggests relative conformational freedom but n-alkyl theophyllines appear to be constrained. Molecules with strongly hydrogen bonding groups (donor and acceptor),even with n-alkyl groups, have lower relative Delta S-f, presumably due to association. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Over a wide range of physiological conditions the quantum yield of non-cyclic electron transport was found to be directly proportional to the product of the photochemical fluorescence quenching (qQ) and the efficiency of excitation capture by open Photosystem II (PS II) reaction centres (Fv/Fm). A simple fluorescence parameter, ΔφF/φFm, which is defined by the difference in fluorescence yield at maximal φFm, and steady-state φFs, divided by φFm, can be used routinely to estimate changes in the quantum yield of non-cyclic electron transport. It is demonstrated that both the concentration of open PS II reaction centres and the efficiency of excitation capture by these centres will determine the quantum yield of non-cyclic electron transport in vivo and that deactivation of excitation within PS II complexes by non-photochemical processes must influence the quantum yield of non-cyclic electron transport.},

  abstract = {A detailed Monte Carlo study of the equilibrium and dynamical properties of the two‐spin facilitated kinetic Ising model proposed by Fredrickson and Andersen (FA) is presented. The model Hamiltonian is that of a spin‐1/2 Ising model in an external magnetic field and, in the present study, contains no interactions between spins. The kinetic properties of the model are described by a master equation with single‐spin‐flip dynamics and highly cooperative flip rates. In particular, the rate at which a spin flips is chosen to be zero unless at least two of its neighbors are spin up. Monte Carlo simulations of the model on a square lattice demonstrate that although there is no evidence for a kinetic singularity (as predicted by FA), the model has dynamical properties much like those of viscous liquids. We find non‐Arrhenius temperature dependence of the average relaxation time and highly nonexponential decay of various relaxation functions. The expression derived by Adam and Gibbs is found to describe the relationship between the average relaxation time and the entropy of the spin model. It is shown that the equilibrium time correlation functions can be accurately fit to the Kohlrausch–Williams–Watts (KWW) expression. The exponent in the KWW function is found to decrease as the temperature is lowered. Studies of multiple‐spin correlation functions demonstrate how spatial correlations develop in the model as it is perturbed from equilibrium and how these relax as the system equilibrates.},

One often-invoked concept is the so-called granular entropy. In this paper, we consider what it would take to compute granular entropy numerically.

Nevertheless, concepts borrowed from equilibrium statistical mechanics are extensively used to characterise granular systems. One often-invoked concept is the so-called granular entropy.

  abstract = {Using molecular dynamic simulations of an extended-simple-point-charge model of water, we investigated the effect of translation-rotation coupling on the motion of the hydrogen atom in a water molecule in low temperature water. We introduce a translation-rotation probability distribution P-CM,P-Omega(r,theta(R),t), where r(t) is the scalar displacement of the center of mass from origin at time t starting from the origin at t=0; and theta(R)(t)=arccos[b(t).b(0)/b(2)] is the angle of rotation of the vector, b, connecting the center of mass of the water molecule to the hydrogen atom position. We developed a procedure to determine P-CM,P-Omega(r,theta(R),t) starting from the van Hove self-correlation function of the center of mass, G(s)(CM)(r,t), taking into account the translation-rotation coupling effect. In the long time region, we use a translation-rotation coupling parameter, Q(*), to determine the angular dependence of P-CM,P-Omega(r,theta(R),t) from G(s)(CM)(r,t). Thus, the dynamics of the hydrogen atoms in a water molecule is fully determined by the van Hove self-correlation function of the center of mass and by the value of the translation-rotation coupling parameter. In particular, we show that the self intermediate scattering function of the hydrogen atom can be calculated with a better accuracy than using the traditional decoupling approximation. The model can be used to analyze incoherent quasielastic neutron scattering spectra of water in the future. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

We quantify the rotational motion with two distinct methods, finding agreement between these methods, in contrast with recent simulation results. The decoupling coincides with the emergence of non-Gaussian displacement distributions for translation whereas rotational displacement distributions remain Gaussian. Ultimately, ourwork demonstrates that as the glass transition is approached, the sample can no longer be approximated as a continuum fluid when considering diffusion.},

The greater the fragility (i.e., deviation away from an Arrhenius temperature dependence for eta), the larger the difference 1-xi. We argue that this breakdown in scaling between the crystal growth kinetics and the viscosity is a manifestation of heterogeneous dynamics in supercooled liquids. In addition, we show that the absolute growth rate at intermediate viscosities is correlated with the entropy difference between the liquid and the crystal.},

We show that these parameters are weakly correlated and probe different distortions, e.g. the angular vs. radial disorders. We first combine these complementary descriptions to analyze the structural rearrangements leading to the density maximum in liquid water. Our results reveal no sign of a heterogeneous mixture and show that the density maximum arises from the depletion in interstitial water molecules upon cooling. In the hydration shell of the hydrophobic moiety of propanol, the order parameters suggest that the water local structure is similar to that in the bulk, with only a very weak depletion in ordered configurations, thus confirming the absence of any iceberg-type structure. Finally, we show that the main structural fluctuations that affect water reorientation dynamics in the bulk are angular distortions, which we explain by the jump hydrogen-bond exchange mechanism.},

However, despite the publication of numerous original papers and reviews on the subject, the mechanisms underpinning the observed improvements in dissolution rate are not yet understood. In this review the current consensus with regard to the solid-state structure and dissolution properties of solid dispersions is critically assessed. In particular the theories of carrier- and drug-controlled dissolution are highlighted. A model is proposed whereby the release behaviour from the dispersions may be understood in terms of the dissolution or otherwise of the drug into the concentrated aqueous polymer layer adjacent to the solid surface, including a derivation of an expression to describe the release of intact particles from the dispersions. The implications of a deeper understanding of the dissolution mechanisms are discussed, with particular emphasis on optimising the choice of carrier and manufacturing method and the prediction of stability problems. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  doi = {10.1063/1.2775928},
  abstract = {We study the thermodynamics of a binary hard-disk mixture in which the ratio of disk diameters is kappa=1.4. We use a recently developed molecular dynamics algorithm to calculate the free-volume entropy of glassy configurations and obtain the configurational entropy (degeneracy) of the supercompressed liquid as a function of density. We find that the configurational entropy of the glasses near the kinetic glass transition is very close to the mixing entropy, suggesting that the degeneracy is zero only for the phase-separated crystal. We explicitly construct an exponential number of jammed packings with densities spanning the spectrum from the accepted "amorphous" glassy state to the phase-separated crystal, thus showing that there is no ideal glass transition in binary hard-disk mixtures. This construction also demonstrates that the ideal glass, defined as having zero configurational entropy, is not amorphous, but instead is nothing more than a phase-separated crystal. This critique of the presumed existence of an ideal glass parallels our previous critique of the idea that there is a most-dense random (close) packing for hard spheres [Torquato et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 2064 (2000)]. We also perform free-energy calculations to determine the equilibrium phase behavior of the system. The calculations predict a first-order freezing transition at a density below the kinetic glass transition. However, this transition appears to be strongly kinetically suppressed and is not observed directly. New simulation techniques are needed in order to gain a more complete understanding of the thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of the binary disk mixture and, in particular, of the demixing process during crystallization.},

A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an n record file are: insertion, O(log n); deletion of the root, O(n(k-1)/k); deletion of a random node, O(log n); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches), O(n log n). Search algorithms are given for partial match queries with t keys specified [proven maximum running time of O(n(k-t)/k)] and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average running time of O(log n).] These performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms for these tasks.

In particular, we describe the simple and elegant interface shared by all learning and processing units in the library and then discuss its advantages in terms of composition and reusability. The paper also comments on implementation details specific to the Python ecosystem and analyzes obstacles faced by users and developers of the library.},

The search for these new variables is made by finding variables which lead to the simplest (i.e. euclidean) expressions for the metric tensor of orientation space. It is shown that the intuitively defined Lattman metric [1] is a scalar multiple of the metric tensor which arises naturally from the Jacobi formulation of the action principle for spherical tops. It is then shown that Euler's quaternion parameters lead to a euclidean form for the orientation metric. These parameters lead to many associated simplifications in the equations of motion of classical rigid bodies including the removal of singularities and spurious behaviour near θ = 0. It is felt that these benefits will translate into increased accuracy and efficiency both for numerical integration of the equations of motion and for performing Monte Carlo integrations of phase space.},

Three aspects will be discussed:(1) There are two classes of materials based on their different modes of crystallization. Molecular dynamics modeling has demonstrated that the growth rate for many simple materials is not thermally activated, but instead depends on the thermal velocity of the atoms.(2) The cooperative processes which give rise to the surface roughening transition. Kinetic Monte Carlo studies played a central role in the development of our understanding of how interface roughness dominates growth morphologies.(3) Solute trapping in alloys. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of alloys have led to an understanding of these kinetic effects during alloy crystallization.},

Based on the simulation results of the above-mentioned ices and previous simulation of ices II, III, IX, IV, and XII, the general regularities of dynamic properties of water molecules in crystalline water ices are formulated.

This study reports the effects of two-step heat treatment on hardness, fracture toughness, and wear of bias varied diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings deposited without buffer layer on silicon substrates using unbalanced magnetron sputtering system. Pristine specimens were directly heated (1-step) at 300 °C in a tube furnace for 30 min and took out after 20 h furnace cooling. For 2-step 300 °C, pristine specimens were heated at 150 °C for 30 min and furnace cooled for 20 h and then re-heated at 300 °C followed by the same procedure. The residual stresses in pristine DLC specimens were calculated with Stoney equation. Raman spectroscopy was performed to understand atomic disorder and clustering under bias and heat treatment effects. The reciprocating wear test was performed to understand the effect of bias voltage and heat treatment on wear volume of DLC coatings. Indentation studies were performed to analyze hardness, cracking behavior, and fracture toughness of bias varied pristine to re-heated specimens. 1-step 300 °C heat treatment decreases hardness and fracture toughness up to 20\% in general, whereas, the 2-step 300 °C heat treatment process generally retained pristine values along with the prominent increase of 43\% hardness and 9\% fracture toughness for specimens which are deposited at a bias of − 60 V and − 140 V respectively.},

  abstract = {Recent experiments on nanostructured materials, such as nanoparticles, nanowires, nanotubes, nanopillars, thin films, and nanocrystals have revealed a host of "ultra-strength" phenomena, defined by stresses in a material component generally rising up to a significant fraction {$>$}110 of its ideal strength - the highest achievable stress of a defect-free crystal at zero temperature. While conventional materials deform or fracture at sample-wide stresses far below the ideal strength, rapid development of nanotechnology has brought about a need to understand ultra-strength phenomena, as nanoscale materials apparently have a larger dynamic range of sustainable stress ("strength") than conventional materials. Ultra-strength phenomena not only have to do with the shape stability and deformation kinetics of a component, but also the tuning of its physical and chemical properties by stress. Reaching ultra-strength enables "elastic strain engineering", where by controlling the elastic strain field one achieves desired electronic, magnetic, optical, phononic, catalytic, etc. properties in the component, imparting a new meaning to Feynman's statement "there's plenty of room at the bottom". This article presents an overview of the principal deformation mechanisms of ultra-strength materials. The fundamental defect processes that initiate and sustain plastic flow and fracture are described, and the mechanics and physics of both displacive and diffusive mechanisms are reviewed. The effects of temperature, strain rate and sample size are discussed. Important unresolved issues are identified. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

In the Ce(75)Al(25) metallic glass (MG), however, we discovered a long-range topological order corresponding to a single crystal of indefinite length. Structural examinations confirm that the MG is truly amorphous, isotropic, and unstrained, yet under 25 gigapascals hydrostatic pressures, every segment of a centimeter-length MG ribbon devitrifies independently into a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal with the identical orientation. By using molecular dynamics simulations and synchrotron x-ray techniques, we elucidate that the mismatch between the large Ce and small Al atoms frustrates the crystallization and causes amorphization, but a long-range fcc topological order still exists. Pressure induces electronic transition in Ce, which eliminates the mismatch and manifests the topological order by the formation of a single crystal.},

  abstract = {Large-scale farming of agricultural crops requires on-time detection of diseases for pest management. Hyperspectral remote sensing data taken from low-altitude flights usually have high spectral and spatial resolutions, which can be very useful in detecting stress in green vegetation. In this study, we used late blight in tomatoes to illustrate the capability of applying hyperspectral remote sensing to monitor crop disease in the field scale and to develop the methodologies for the purpose. A series of field experiments was conducted to collect the canopy spectral reflectance of tomato plants in a diseased tomato field in Salinas Valley of California. The disease severity varied from stage 1 (the light symptom), to stage 4 (the sever damage). The economic damage of the crop caused by the disease is around the disease stage 3. An airborne visible infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) image with 224 bands within the wavelength range of 0.4-2.5 ??m was acquired during the growing season when the field data were collected. The spectral reflectance of the field samples indicated that the near infrared (NIR) region, especially 0.7-1.3 ??m, was much more valuable than the visible range to detect crop disease. The difference of spectral reflectance in visible range between health plants and the infected ones at stage 3 was only 1.19\%, while the difference in the NIR region was high, 10\%. We developed an approach including the minimum noise fraction (MNF) transformation, multi-dimensional visualization, pure pixels endmember selection and spectral angle mapping (SAM) to process the hyperspectral image for identification of diseased tomato plants. The results of MNF transformation indicated that the first 28 eigenimages contain useful information for classification of the pixels and the rest were mainly noise-dominated due to their low eigenvalues that had few signals. Therefore, the 28 signal eigenimages were used to generate a multi-dimensional visualization space for endmember spectra selection and SAM. Classification with the SAM technique of plants' spectra showed that the late blight diseased tomatoes at stage 3 or above could be separated from the healthy plants while the less infected plants (at stage 1 or 2) were difficult to separate from the healthy plants. The results of the image analysis were consistent with the field spectra. The mapped disease distribution at stage 3 or above from the image showed an accurate conformation of late blight occurrence in the field. This result not only continued the capability of hyperspectral remote sensing in detecting crop disease for precision disease management in the real world, but also demonstrated that the spectra-based classification approach is an applicable method to crop disease identification. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {We compare dynamical heterogeneities in equilibrated supercooled liquids and in the nonequilibrium glassy state within the framework of the random first order transition theory. Fluctuating mobility generation and transport in the glass are treated by numerically solving stochastic continuum equations for mobility and fictive temperature fields that arise from an extended mode coupling theory containing activated events. Fluctuating spatiotemporal structures in aging and rejuvenating glasses lead to dynamical heterogeneity in glasses with characteristics distinct from those found in the equilibrium supercooled liquid. The non-Gaussian distribution of activation free energies, the stretching exponent β, and the growth of characteristic lengths are studied along with the four-point dynamical correlation function. Asymmetric thermodynamic responses upon heating and cooling are predicted to be the result of the heterogeneity and the out-of-equilibrium behavior of glasses below Tg. Our numerical results agree with experimental calorimetry. We numerically confirm the prediction of Lubchenko and Wolynes in the glass that the dynamical heterogeneity can lead to noticeably bimodal distributions of local fictive temperatures during some histories of preparation which explains in a unified way recent experimental observations that have been interpreted as coming from there being two distinct equilibration mechanisms in glasses.},

The structure of liquids is described in terms of spherical harmonic representations of topology of local clusters and the orientational correlation among them. The variation of the averaged topology of the nearest-neighbor clusters exhibits an anomalous behavior at temperatures between the glass transition temperature (Tg) and a temperature much above Tg. This anomalous behavior is shown to be caused by aggregation of the clusters with icosahedral topology. The number of the icosahedral clusters increases progressively with decreasing temperature, and, at Tg, the increase is abruptly arrested. Within the icosahedral aggregates, the strong mirror-related orientational correlation exists with a correlation length growing over 10 Å near the glass transition temperature. The percolation of the icosahedral clusters and the mirror-related orientational order leading to the glass transition are discussed.},

The scope of applications is limited due to the small thickness in the region of only tens of microns. The research effort in the past two decades, mainly pioneered by a Japanese- and a US-group of scientists, has substantially relaxed this size constrain. Some bulk metallic glasses can have tensile strength up to 3000MPa with good corrosion resistance, reasonable toughness, low internal friction and good processability. Bulk metallic glasses are now being used in consumer electronic industries, sporting goods industries, etc. In this paper, the authors reviewed the recent development of new alloy systems of bulk metallic glasses. The properties and processing technologies relevant to the industrial applications of these alloys are also discussed here. The behaviors of bulk metallic glasses under extreme conditions such as high pressure and low temperature are especially addressed in this review. In order that the scope of applications can be broadened, the understanding of the glass-forming criteria is important for the design of new alloy systems and also the processing techniques. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Exploring BMGs materials becomes one of the hottest topics in the materials science field. To date, there is very active worldwide development of new BMGs, and extensive efforts have been carried out to understand and improve the glass-forming ability of metallic materials supported by large government and industry programs in North America, Asia, and Europe. Minor addition or microalloying technique, which has been widely used in other metallurgical fields, plays effective and important roles in formation, crystallization, thermal stability and property improvement of BMGs. This simple approach provides a powerful tool for the BMG-forming alloys development and design. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the history and the recent developments of this technique in the field of BMGs. The roles of the minor addition in the formation and the properties of the BMGs and the BMG-based composites will be discussed and summarized within the framework of thermodynamics, kinetics and microstructure.

So far, the established empirical correlations of GFA (ref. ) are statistical guides at best and lack a microscopic rationale. Although simulations have the potential to provide this physical insight into the maximum crystallization rate, crystal nucleation is often too slow to be observed. In contrast, measuring the growth rate of a planar crystal surface represents an accessible route to understanding ordering kinetics. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to show that the crystal growth rate for an important binary glass former, CuZr, is significantly slower than that of a poor glass former, NiAl. In accounting for this difference, we find that the crystal/liquid interface in NiAl exhibits a significantly greater width than that of CuZr. Our results suggest that the crystal/liquid interfacial structure exerts an important influence on the GFA of alloys.},

Diffusion is enhanced by a factor of approximately 100 at 338 K when compared to the prediction of the Stokes-Einstein model. In combination with previous neutron reflectivity experiments, these measurements quantify the length scale at which dynamics cross over to non-Fickian behavior in supercooled TNB. Comparisons are made between this diffusion data and other measurements of dynamics in supercooled TNB, including probe diffusion and crystal growth rates. An earlier report of self-diffusion coefficients for TNB was in error because the samples were prepared by vapor deposition at T(g) - 50 K, creating very stable glasses in which the concentration profile does not evolve by Fickian diffusion.},

The hyperspectral data were gathered for shrubs, grasses, weeds, and agricultural crop species from the four ecoregions of African savannas using a 1-nm-wide hand-held spectroradiometer but was aggregated to 10-nm-wide bandwidths to match the first spaceborne hyperspectral sensor, Hyperion. After accounting for atmospheric widows and/or areas of significant noise, a total of 168 narrowbands in 400-2500 nm was used in the analysis. Rigorous data mining techniques consisting of principal component analysis (PCA), lambda-lambda R2 models (LL R2M), stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA), and derivative greenness vegetation indices (DGVI) established 22 optimal bands (in 400-2500 nm spectral range) that best characterize and classify vegetation and agricultural crops. Overall accuracies of over 90\% were attained when the 13-22 best narrowbands were used in classifying vegetation and agricultural crop species. Beyond 22 bands, accuracies only increase marginally up to 30 bands. Accuracies become asymptotic or near zero beyond 30 bands, rendering 138 of the 168 narrowbands redundant in extracting vegetation and agricultural crop information. Relative to Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) broadbands, the best hyperspectral narrowbands provided an increased accuracy of 9-43\% when classifying shrubs, weeds, grasses, and agricultural crop species. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {We compute analytically and numerically the four-point correlation function that characterizes nontrivial cooperative dynamics in glassy systems within several models of glasses: elastoplastic deformations, mode-coupling theory (MCT), collectively rearranging regions (CRR's), diffusing defects, and kinetically constrained models (KCM's). Some features of the four-point susceptibility chi(4) (t) are expected to be universal: at short times we expect a power-law increase in time as t(4) due to ballistic motion (t(2) if the dynamics is Brownian) followed by an elastic regime (most relevant deep in the glass phase) characterized by a t or sqrt[t] growth, depending on whether phonons are propagative or diffusive. We find in both the beta and early alpha regime that chi(4) approximately t(mu), where mu is directly related to the mechanism responsible for relaxation. This regime ends when a maximum of chi(4) is reached at a time t= t(*) of the order of the relaxation time of the system. This maximum is followed by a fast decay to zero at large times. The height of the maximum also follows a power law chi(4) (t(*)) approximately t(*lambda). The value of the exponents mu and lambda allows one to distinguish between different mechanisms. For example, freely diffusing defects in d=3 lead to mu=2 and lambda=1 , whereas the CRR scenario rather predicts either mu=1 or a logarithmic behavior depending on the nature of the nucleation events and a logarithmic behavior of chi(4) (t(*)) . MCT leads to mu=b and lambda=1/gamma , where b and gamma are the standard MCT exponents. We compare our theoretical results with numerical simulations on a Lennard-Jones and a soft-sphere system. Within the limited time scales accessible to numerical simulations, we find that the exponent mu is rather small, mu{$<$}1 , with a value in reasonable agreement with the MCT predictions, but not with the prediction of simple diffusive defect models, KCM's with noncooperative defects, and CRR's. Experimental and numerical determination of chi(4) (t) for longer time scales and lower temperatures would yield highly valuable information on the glass formation mechanism.},

  abstract = {A new basin-sampling scheme is introduced to obtain equilibrium thermodynamic properties by combining results from global optimisation and parallel tempering calculations. Regular minimisation is used to obtain a two-dimensional density of states. A model anharmonic form is optimised using a multihistogram approach for potential energy bins corresponding to local minima, connecting the results obtained for low and high temperatures. This procedure provides accurate densities of states and thermodynamic properties for benchmark atomic clusters exhibiting broken ergodicity. It can also be used to calculate the potential energy density of local minima for distinct permutation-inversion isomers and distinct structures.},

We examine the internal transitions within the elementary mobile defect (christened the 'zipper') that allow it to move, as well as the mechanisms by which the zipper is created and annihilated. The structural relaxation of the random tiling phase is quantified and we show that this relaxation is well described by a model based on the distribution of waiting times for each atom to be visited by the diffusing zipper. This system, representing one of the few instances where a well defined mobile defect is capable of structural relaxation, can provide a valuable test case for general theories of relaxation in complex and disordered materials.},

In this work, we review several important details of these computations. In particular, we study in detail the angle-resolved contact force distribution, finite-size effects, the maximum allowed shear stress and the effect of walls. In addition, we investigate how well the force network ensemble resembles systems with ‘real’ interactions.},

Nanocrystline metals are metals with grain sizes in the nanometre range, they have a number of technologically interesting properties such as much increased hardness and yield strength. Our simulations show that the deformation mechanisms are different in these materials than in coarse-grained materials. The main deformation is occurring in the grain boundaries, and only little dislocation activity is seen inside the grains. This leads to a hardening of the material as the grain size is increased, and the volume fraction of grain boundaries is decreased.},

  abstract = {Melting and freezing transitions in two dimensional (2D) systems are known to show highly unusual characteristics. Most of the earlier studies considered atomic systems: the melting of 2D molecular solids is still largely unexplored. In order to understand the role of anisotropy as well as multiple energy and length scales present in molecular systems, here we report computer simulation studies of melting of 2D molecular systems. We computed a limited portion of the solid-liquid phase diagram. We find that the interplay between the strength of isotropic and anisotropic interactions can give rise to rich phase diagram consisting of isotropic liquid and two crystalline phases—honeycomb and oblique. The nature of the transition depends on the relative strength of the anisotropic interaction and a strongly first order melting turns into a weakly first order transition on increasing the strength of the isotropic interaction. This crossover can be attributed to an increase in stiffness of the solid phase free energy minimum on increasing the strength of the anisotropic interaction. The defects involved in melting of molecular systems are quite different from those known for the atomic systems.},

A state with short-range translational order, but extended correlations in the orientations of particle clusters, starts to develop about 10\% below the equilibrium melting temperature in a supercooled Lennard-Jones liquid. The order is predominantly icosahedral, although there is also a cubic component which we attribute to the periodic boundary conditions. Results are obtained for liquids cooled in an icosahedral pair potential as well. Only a modest amount of orientational order appears in a relaxed Finney dense-random-packing model.

The obtained stable lipid membranes are quantitatively analyzed with respect to their local structure and their degree of order. At equilibrium, we obtain self-stabilizing bilayer membrane structures that exhibit a bending stiffness κB and compression modulus KC comparable to experimental measurements under physiological conditions. We present a phase diagram of our lipid model which covers a sol-gel transition, a liquid (or gel-like) phase including stable bilayer structures and vesicle formation, as well as a quasi-crystalline phase.

The main diffusion carriers in Li2CO3 below 0.98 V are excess Li-ion interstitials; however, above 3.98 V, Li-ion vacancies become the dominant diffusion carrier type, and they have the same concentration in the voltage range of 0.98–3.98 V.

Only the former determines kappa(T) for low-temperature crystals, but both operate in the liquid phase. As a supercooled liquid passes downward in temperature through a glass transition, the structural contribution to kappa(T) switches off to produce the experimentally familiar drop in this quantity.

If the thermal ensemble of atomic configurations is mapped (by steepest descent on the potential hypersurface) onto potential energy minima, the pair correlation function from the resulting transformed configurations exhibits substantial image enhancement, revealing short‐range order in a much more vivid fashion. Previous studies of model atomic liquids have demonstrated that at fixed density, mapped short‐range order is virtually independent of the initial temperature, and thereby amounts to an ‘‘inherent structure’’ for the liquid. The present paper investigates steepest‐descent mapping and inherent structure for hard spheres, construed as the infinite‐n limit for pair potentials (a/r)n. Methods used are both analytical and simulational, the latter involving molecular dynamics for n=12 and 24. Results show that inherent structures in the hard‐sphere limit are randomly packed configurations, where particle radii have been inflated to the point of jamming.},

  abstract = {Glass is a microscopically disordered, solid form of matter that results when a fluid is cooled or compressed in such a manner that it does not crystallize. Almost all types of materials are capable of glass formation, including polymers, metal alloys and molten salts. Given such diversity, general principles by which different glass-forming materials can be systematically classified are invaluable. One such principle is the classification of glass-formers according to their fragility. Fragility measures the rapidity with which a liquid's properties (such as viscosity) change as the glassy state is approached. Although the relationship between the fragility, configurational entropy and features of the energy landscape (the complicated dependence of energy on configuration) of a glass-former have been analysed previously, a detailed understanding of the origins of fragility is lacking. Here I use simulations to analyse the relationship between fragility and quantitative measures of the energy landscape for a model liquid whose fragility depends on its bulk density. The results reveal that fragility depends on changes in the vibrational properties of individual energy minima in addition to their total number and spread in energy. A thermodynamic expression for fragility is derived, which is in quantitative agreement with kinetic fragilities obtained from the liquid's diffusivity.},

  abstract = {A prerequisite for thermodynamic modeling of silicate melts is a knowledge of basic thermodynamic data for glasses and liquids. The recent advances in the measurement and rationalization of these data are thus reviewed in this paper, with particular emphasis on the influence of the thermal history of glasses on their various thermochemical properties. Above room temperature the heat capacities of glasses (Cpg) do not depend sensitively on thermal history. They are almost additive functions of the chemical composition, which can now be empirically calculated to within about 1\%. In contrast, the heat capacities of liquids (Cp •) do not generally vary linearly with composition, especially for aluminosilicates. But more experimental data would be useful to improve the accuracy of the models proposed for calculating the heat capacity of molten rocks. The available enthalpies of fusion (AHs), which depend measurably on the thermal history of the glasses used in solution calorimetry measurements, are summa-rized for silicates of geochemical or theoretical interest, and new values have been derived for some additional compositions. The usefulness of these data for calculating the entropies of liquids is pointed out, in particular for calculating the entropies and configurational entropies of the liquids. Finally, available enthalpies of mixing of glasses and liquids are also summarized. A few examples are used to illustrate the major influence of the thermal history of glasses on their mixing properties, and it is suggested that the ternary excess enthalpies of mixing observed in simple systems could be a spurious consequence of neglecting this influence.},

The computer simulation is based on a realistic atom-atom potential and is performed in the nematic phase. Singlet orientational distribution functions are reconstructed from order parameters employing several methods, and the estimated distributions are compared with those obtained directly from the trajectory. Transport properties have been studied by calculating translational diffusion coefficients in directions both parallel and perpendicular to the liquid crystalline director. The simulated diffusion coefficients were found to be of the same order of magnitude as those measured in experiments. Second rank orientational time correlation functions are used to investigate molecular reorientations and significant deviations from the small step rotational diffusion model are established. Molecular structure and internal dynamics of 5CB have been examined by correlating the time dependence of dihedral angles with effective torsional potentials.},

  abstract = {Most materials attain a glassy state at low temperatures under suitable methods of preparation. This state exhibits the mechanical properties of a solid, but shows microscopic structural disorder1,2. A comprehensive understanding of the glassy state is, however, still lacking3. A widespread assumption is that the non-exponential relaxation processes observed in the dynamics of glasses — and also in protein dynamics, protein folding and population dynamics — are (in common with other manifestations of complex dynamics) strongly influenced by the underlying energy landscape associated with the structural configurations that the system may adopt. But concrete evidence for this in studies of glass formation has been scarce. Here we present such evidence, obtained from computer simulations of a model glass-forming liquid. We demonstrate that the onset of non-exponential relaxation corresponds to a well defined temperature below which the depth of the potential-energy minima explored by the liquid increases with decreasing temperature, and above which it does not. At lower temperatures, we observe a sharp transition when the liquid gets trapped in the deepest accessible energy basin. This transition temperature depends on the cooling rate, in a manner analogous to the experimental glass transition. We also present evidence that the barrier heights separating potential-energy minima sampled by the liquid increase abruptly at a temperature above the glass transition but well below the onset of non-exponential relaxation. This identification of a relationship between static, topographic features of the energy landscape and complex dynamics holds the promise of a clearer, possibly thermodynamic, understanding of the glass transition.

  abstract = {The remote sensing literature on laser-induced chlorophyll fluorescence has indicated a relation between chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthesis but, so far, has not presented a quantitative interpretation of the measurements. The present article presents the development of a model to quantify the gross photosynthesis on the basis of remote measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence and radiance with the Laser Environmental Active Fluorosensor (LEAF-NL). Combined measurements of the laser-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and CO 2 exchange have been carried out during several days. Drought and ozone stress were imposed in two separate experiments. The laser-induced fluorescence measurements show a remarkable behavior. After sunrise the fluorescence yield rises first, but at high radiation and high temperature the fluorescence yield may decline below the nighttime fluorescence. This extremely strong quenching of fluorescence is attributed to photosystem deactivation. On the basis of the available laser-induced fluorescence data, a photosystem energy partitioning model is developed and finally used to predict photosynthetic electron transport. The results of this new model are compared with those of the current theory and with the CO 2 assimilation data. Contrary to the current theory, the results from the new model show a fairly good correspondence with the CO 2 assimilation data. It is believed that the present results are a significant step forward to the development of practical applications.},

This definition is operational but it sidesteps fundamental controversies about the glass: Is the transition a purely dynamical phenomenon [2]? This would mean that ergodicity gets broken, but that thermodynamic properties of the liquid remain unchanged across the transition if determined as thermodynamic equilibrium averages over the whole phase space. The opposite view [3-6] claims that an underlying thermodynamic phase transition is responsible for the dramatic slowdown at the liquid-glass boundary. Such a phase transition (which shows up in proper equilibrium phase space averages) would trigger the dynamic standstill, and then get masked by it. A recent Monte Carlo algorithm [7] introduces non-local moves for hard-core systems in a way which preserves micro-reversibility. Here we use this method to equilibrate a two-dimensional hard disc system far within its glassy phase. We show that indications of a thermodynamic transition are lacking up to very high densities, and that the glass is indistinguishable from the liquid on purely thermodynamic grounds.},

  abstract = {The increasingly sluggish response of a supercooled liquid as it nears its glass transition (for example, refrigerated honey) is prototypical of glassy dynamics found in proteins, neural networks and superconductors. The notion that molecules rearrange cooperatively has long been postulated to explain diverging relaxation times and broadened (non-exponential) response functions near the glass transition. Recently, cooperativity was observed and analysed in colloid glasses and in simulations of binary liquids well above the glass transition. But nanometre-scale studies of cooperativity at the molecular glass transition are lacking. Important issues to be resolved include the precise form of the cooperativity and its length scale, and whether the broadened response is intrinsic to individual cooperative regions, or arises only from heterogeneity in an ensemble of such regions. Here we describe direct observations of molecular cooperativity near the glass transition in polyvinylacetate (PVAc), using nanometre-scale probing of dielectric fluctuations. Molecular clusters switched spontaneously among two to four distinct configurations, producing random telegraph noise. Our analysis of these noise signals and their power spectra reveals that individual clusters exhibit transient dynamical heterogeneity and non-exponential kinetics.},

  volume = {93},
  issn = {24700053},
  doi = {10.1103/PhysRevE.93.042608},
  abstract = {The influence of an applied shear on the planar crystal-melt interface is modeled by a nonlinear stochastic partial differential equation of the interface fluctuations. A feature of this theory is the asymmetric destruction of interface fluctuations due to advection of the crystal protrusions on the liquid side of the interface only. We show that this model is able to qualitatively reproduce the nonequilibrium coexistence line found in simulations. The impact of shear on spherical clusters is also addressed. The relative stability of a crystal phase at its liquid melt is established, at equilibrium, by the relative magnitudes of the Boltzmann-weighted configuration spaces for each phase. The problem of establishing the crystal-liquid coexistence point is thus well posed and, in the thermodynamic limit, independent of the mechanism of the transition or the characteristics of the interface between the two phases. This happy state vanishes, however, when we subject our system to some external gradient, such that one or both phases are maintained in a nonequilibrium steady state. In this paper we shall address the problem of coexistence of a crystal and its melt under the influence of an applied shear stress, one small enough that it induces only a linear response in either phase. This means that the crystal will be elastically strained while the liquid will experience a Newtonian shear flow. We consider the case of a planar interface between strained crystal and shearing liquid, one orientated such that the stress gradient is normal to the interface and the liquid flow is parallel to the surface. [The alternative, in which the stress gradient is parallel to the surface, would result in a more complex (and physically ambiguous) situation, with either no fluid flow or a fluid flow characterized by two gradients.] The combination of crystallization and shear flow arises in a wide range of phenomena. Some of these, such as shear-induced crystallization of polymers [1], lyotropic solutions [2], colloidal suspensions [3], and metallic alloys [4], involve nonlinear effects associated with perturbation of the liquid structure. Nonlinear behavior in the crystal phase includes yielding and fracture and, in the case of colloidal crystals, sliding crystals. Restricting ourselves to linear response in both liquid and crystal, we shall specifically address the suppression of crystallization by an applied shear, a phenomenon that has been reported in colloids [5] and associated with wear between metal surfaces [6] and stick-slip lubrication in thin films [7]. Modeling of shear-induced melting of molecular crystals [8] has indicated that the phenomenon should be experimentally observable for viscous materials such as waxes (e.g., eicosane). We note that our restriction to linear response in the bulk phases does not preclude the possibility of nonlinear rheology of the two-phase system due to shear-induced disordering [8]. A number of previous studies have addressed the problem of the nonequilibrium coexistence between strained crystal and flowing liquid. Ramaswamy and Renn [9] proposed that the depression of the freezing point was the result of the increase in the chemical potential of the crystal due to elastic strain. The fundamental assumption here was that a balance of chemical potentials described coexistence even when the liquid phase was flowing. In a simulation of a Lennard-Jones crystal and liquid under shear, Butler and Harrowell [10] found that the depression of the crystal-liquid coexistence point (as measured by the stability of a planar crystal-liquid interface) due to shear flow was substantially larger than could be accounted for by the elastic energy of the crystal proposed in Ref. [9]. The authors of Ref. [10] found that no reasonable argument based on equating properties of the two bulk phases could account for the observed nonequilibrium coexistence line. Instead, it was proposed that it was the stability of the interface that was determining the coexistence point. The goal of this paper is to clarify this latter proposal and to develop a model capable of both articulating just how the shear flow influences the interface stability and to provide the basis for a quantitative treatment of this phenomenon. We shall consider the case of two dimensions with a one-dimensional (1D) interface. The generalization to three dimensions should be straightforward. Let h(x) be the height of the interface at position x parallel to the interface and let y {$>$} h(x) lie in the liquid phase and y {$<$} h(x) lie in the solid phase. The position of the crystal-liquid interface has been shown to be accurately identified through the use of local order parameters such as that developed by Briels and Tepper for the face-centered-cubic crystal [11]. Karma [12] has demonstrated that, if temperature and density fluctuations are neglected, the fluctuations in the interface height at coexistence can be described by the following Langevin equation,},

We also show that quaternions, although up to now solely used for animation pur- poses, can be used successfully in the field of modelling and rendering and we prove that we can speed up the rendering algo- rithm by using quaternions.},

  abstract = {Structural transformation is prone to alteration under crystalline deformation for multiple structural symmetry groups. Such transformation usually includes a large-scale number representing atomic bonding and material deformation mechanisms in the vicinity of voids, dislocation cores and other defects for diverse crystal systems. Selected analytical methods should be able to distinguish prefect crystal structures of multiple crystalline systems while extracting distinct crystalline symmetry groups from nearby stacking faults, crack surfaces or other features. Some work has been done to optimize such identification in the form of Common Neighborhood Parameter CNP formulation. In this paper, an improved approach towards structural identification revolving around predominance of common nearest neighbors of atoms is introduced with two separate parameterizations for arbitrary crystal structures. The approach is called Predominant Common Neighborhood Parameter PCNP. The method is proposed to characterize cross-species interactions with more complex centrosymmetric space groups or crystals with no common first nearest neighbors for certain atomic species. We validate the method against conventional Centrosymmetry Parameter CSP and Common Neighbor Analysis CNA for multiple simulation conditions, where the introduced method illustrates higher sensitivity than CNP analysis for multiple geometries and defect characterization regardless of the atom's species. Further enhancement of the method has been introduced to include a complex, non-monoatomic centrosymmetric crystal with a P6/mmm space group, typically found in certain ceramic materials such as Zirconium Diboride.},

Early experiments with semiconductors were hampered by the extreme sensitivity of the electronic properties to minute concentrations of impurities. Semiconductors were viewed as a family of solids with irreproducible properties. Scientific efforts overcame this idiosyncrasy and turned the art of impurity doping into today's exceedingly useful and reproducible technology that is used to control precisely electrical conductivity, composition, and minority-carrier lifetimes over wide ranges. Native defects such as vacancies and self-interstitials control basic processes, foremost self- and dopant diffusion. The structural properties of dislocations and higher dimensional defects have been studied with atomic resolution, but a thorough theoretical understanding of their electronic properties is incomplete. Reactions between defects within the host lattices are increasingly better understood and are used for gettering and electrical passivation of unwanted impurities. Metastable defects such as DX centers and the EL2-related arsenic antisite are briefly discussed. The recent development of isotopically controlled semiconductors has created new research opportunities in this field.},

  abstract = {The use of molecular dynamics simulation and improved many-body potentials make it possible to compare displacement cascade evolution in different materials. However, the extreme variability between individual cascades requires multiple simulations at nominally identical conditions of temperature and energy in order to assure that the comparison is statistically valid. We describe such a comparison of copper and iron in this paper. Over 600 cascades have been investigated, with simulation energies in the range 60 eV to 10 keV and temperatures from 100 to 900 K. The evolution of the cascades is similar in both materials, with the development of a highly disordered core and the emission of focusons and replacement collision sequences during the collisional phase of the cascade. The majority of vacancy-type defects are found in the cascade core when in-cascade recombination is complete, while the interstitial-type defects tend to be distributed around the periphery of this region. The final defect structure has been characterized by the total surviving defect fraction, and the number and size of the point defect clusters produced. Since these parameters have significant implications for the nuclear industry in its assessment of radiation damage, we show how they depend on cascade energy and temperature. To illustrate their importance, we provide an example of how the molecular dynamics results can be used in a rate theory model of ferritic steel embrittlement.},

We report here a detailed study of the phase diagram of suspensions of colloidal spheres which interact through a steep repulsive potential. With increasing particle concentration we observed a progression from colloidal fluid, to fluid and crystal phases in coexistence, to fully crystallized samples. At the highest concentrations we obtained very viscous samples in which full crystallization had not occurred after several months and in which the particles appeared to be arranged as an amorphous ‘colloidal glass’. The empirical phase diagram can be reproduced reasonably well by an effective hard-sphere model. The observation of the colloidal glass phase is interesting both in itself and because of possible relevance to the manufacture of high-strength ceramics8.},

  abstract = {Poorly water-soluble drug candidates often emerge from contemporary drug discovery programs, and present formulators with considerable technical challenges. The absorption of such compounds when presented in the crystalline state to the gastrointestinal tract is typically dissolution rate-limited, and the drugs are typically BCS class II or class IV compounds. Class IV compounds, which have low membrane permeability as well as poor aqueous solubility, are often poor candidates for development, unless the dose is expected to be low. The rate and extent of absorption of class II compounds is highly dependent on the performance of the formulated product. These drugs can be successfully formulated for oral administration, but care needs to be taken with formulation design to ensure consistent bioavailability. Essentially the options available involve either reduction of particle size (of crystalline drug) or formulation of the drug in solution, as an amorphous system or lipid formulation. The performance of amorphous or lipid formulations is dependent on their interaction with the contents of the gastrointestinal tract, therefore, a formulation exercise should involve the use of techniques which can predict the influence of gut physiology. A major consideration is the fate of metastable supersaturated solutions of drug, which are formed typically after dispersion of the formulation and its exposure to gastrointestinal digestion. A better understanding of the factors which affect drug crystallization is required, and the introduction of standardised predictive in vitro tests would be valuable. Although many bioavailability studies have been performed with poorly water-soluble drugs, thus far this research field has lacked a systematic approach. The use of a lipid formulation classification system combined with appropriate in vitro tests will help to establish a database for in vitro-in vivo correlation studies. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  title = {Quaternions : {{From Classical Mechanics}} to {{Computer Graphics}} , and {{Beyond}}},
  abstract = {The theory of quaternions was introduced in the mid nineteenth century, and it found many applications in classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and the theory of relativity. Quaternions were also later used in aerospace applications and flight simulators, particularly when inertial attitude referencing and related control schemes where employed. However, it is only in the recent past that graphics and game programmers discovered the true potential of quaternions and started using it as a powerful tool for describing rotations about an arbitrary axis. From computer graphics, the application domain of quaternions soon expanded into other fields such as visualization, fractals and virtual reality. This paper provides an overview of the various analytical properties of quaternions and their usefulness in the areas of computer/robot vision, computer graphics and animation. Particular emphasis is given to vision algorithms for 3D pose estimation, animation techniques involving viewpoint/object rotations, motion interpolation algorithms, and quaternion fractals. The benefit of using quaternions over other representations such as Euler angles is not just limited to singularity free kinematics relations – Quaternions allow us to derive closed form solutions for algebraic systems involving unknown rotational parameters. Some of the neat mathematical characteristics of quaternions in the complex space together with a set of useful formulae are included for the benefit of the mathematically inclined.},

The slow cooling in vacuum furnace and static air resulted in precipitation of ω phase. The formation of this phase secures an increase in the strength and hardness value, however stands detrimental to the ductility. The α″ martensite is formed due to accelerated cooling in liquid nitrogen, water and oil. This phase remains neutral to the ductility of the alloy, while its excessive formation increases the hardness and shear strength.

  abstract = {The mechanical properties of nanocrystalline materials are reviewed, with emphasis on their constitutive response and on the fundamental physical mechanisms. In a brief introduction, the most important synthesis methods are presented. A number of aspects of mechanical behavior are discussed, including the deviation from the Hall-Petch slope and possible negative slope, the effect of porosity, the difference between tensile and compressive strength, the limited ductility, the tendency for shear localization, the fatigue and creep responses. The strain-rate sensitivity of FCC metals is increased due to the decrease in activation volume in the nanocrystalline regime; for BCC metals this trend is not observed, since the activation volume is already low in the conventional polycrystalline regime. In fatigue, it seems that the S-N curves show improvement due to the increase in strength, whereas the da/dN curve shows increased growth velocity (possibly due to the smoother fracture requiring less energy to propagate). The creep results are conflicting: while some results indicate a decreased creep resistance consistent with the small grain size, other experimental results show that the creep resistance is not negatively affected. Several mechanisms that quantitatively predict the strength of nanocrystalline metals in terms of basic defects (dislocations, stacking faults, etc.) are discussed: break-up of dislocation pile-ups, core-and-mantle, grain-boundary sliding, grain-boundary dislocation emission and annihilation, grain coalescence, and gradient approach. Although this classification is broad, it incorporates the major mechanisms proposed to this date. The increased tendency for twinning, a direct consequence of the increased separation between partial dislocations, is discussed. The fracture of nanocrystalline metals consists of a mixture of ductile dimples and shear regions; the dimple size, while much smaller than that of conventional polycrystalline metals, is several times larger than the grain size. The shear regions are a direct consequence of the increased tendency of the nanocrystalline metals to undergo shear localization. The major computational approaches to the modeling of the mechanical processes in nanocrystalline metals are reviewed with emphasis on molecular dynamics simulations, which are revealing the emission of partial dislocations at grain boundaries and their annihilation after crossing them.},

In this paper we describe the restriction of such searches to predefined isopointal sets, breaking the problem into countable sub-problems which exploit crystal symmetries to reduce the dimensionality of the search space. Applying this method to the search for maximally packed mixtures of hard spheres of two sizes, we demonstrate that the densest packed structures can be identified by searches within a couple of isopointal sets. For the A2B system, the densest known packings over the entire tested range 0.2 {$<$} rA/rB {$<$} 2.5, including some improvements on previous optima, can all be identified by searches within a single isopointal set. In the case of the AB composition, searches of two isopointal sets generate the densest packed structures over the radius ratio range 0.2 {$<$} rA/rB {$<$} 5.0.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in molecular simulations allow the evaluation of previously unattainable observables, such as rate constants for protein folding. However, these calculations are usually computationally expensive, and even significant computing resources may result in a small number of independent estimates spread over many orders of magnitude. Such small-sample, high “log-variance” data are not readily amenable to analysis using the standard uncertainty (i.e., “standard error of the mean”) because unphysical negative limits of confidence intervals result. Bootstrapping, a natural alternative guaranteed to yield a confidence interval within the minimum and maximum values, also exhibits a striking systematic bias of the lower confidence limit in log space. As we show, bootstrapping artifactually assigns high probability to improbably low mean values. A second alternative, the Bayesian bootstrap strategy, does not suffer from the same deficit and is more logically consistent with the type of confidence interval desired. The Bayesian bootstrap provides uncertainty intervals that are more reliable than those from the standard bootstrap method but must be used with caution nevertheless. Neither standard nor Bayesian bootstrapping can overcome the intrinsic challenge of underestimating the mean from small-size, high log-variance samples. Our conclusions are based on extensive analysis of model distributions and reanalysis of multiple independent atomistic simulations. Although we only analyze rate constants, similar considerations will apply to related calculations, potentially including highly nonlinear averages like the Jarzynski relation.},

  abstract = {Liquids are often assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic at any lengthscale and translationally invariant. The standard liquid-state theory is constructed on the basis of this picture and thus basically described in terms of the two-body density correlation. This picture is certainly valid at rather high temperatures, where a liquid is in a highly disordered state. However, it may not necessarily be valid at low temperatures or for a system which has strong directional bonding. Indeed, there remain fundamental unsolved problems in liquid science, which are difficult to explain by such a theory. They include water's thermodynamic and kinetic anomalies, liquid–liquid transitions, liquid–glass transitions, and liquid–solid transitions. We argue that for the physical description of these phenomena it is crucial to take into account many-body (orientational) correlations, which have been overlooked in the conventional liquid-state theory. It is essential to recognise that a liquid can lower its free energy by local or mesoscopic ordering without breaking global symmetry. Since such ordering must involve at least a central particle and its neighbours, which are more than two particles, it is intrinsically a consequence of many-body correlations. Particularly important ordering is associated with local breakdown of rotational symmetry, i.e., bond orientational ordering. We emphasize that translational ordering is global whereas orientational ordering can be local. Because of the strong first-order nature of translational ordering, its growth in a liquid state is modest. Thus any structural ordering in a liquid should be associated primarily with orientational ordering and not with translational ordering. We show that bond orientational ordering indeed plays a significant role in all the above-mentioned phenomena at least for (quasi-)single-component liquids. In this Introductory Lecture, we discuss how these phenomena can be explained by such local or mesoscopic ordering in a unified manner.},

By computer simulations of the hard-sphere model we reveal the mechanism by which thermal fluctuations drive the transition from the supercooled liquid state to the crystal state. In particular we show that fluctuations in bond orientational order trigger the nucleation process, contrary to the common belief that the transition is initiated by density fluctuations. Moreover, the analysis of bond orientational fluctuations shows that these not only act as seeds of the nucleation process, but also i) determine the particular polymorph which is to be nucleated from them and ii) at high density favour the formation of fivefold structures which can frustrate the formation of crystals. These results can shed new light on our understanding of the relationship between crystallization and vitrification.},

  shorttitle = {Bond Orientational Order in Liquids},
  abstract = {There are at least three fundamental states of matter, depending upon temperature and pressure: gas, liquid, and solid (crystal). These states are separated by first-order phase transitions between them. In both gas and liquid phases a complete translational and rotational symmetry exist, whereas in a solid phase both symmetries are broken. In intermediate phases between liquid and solid, which include liquid crystal and plastic crystal phases, only one of the two symmetries is preserved. Among the fundamental states of matter, the liquid state is the most poorly understood. We argue that it is crucial for a better understanding of liquids to recognize that a liquid generally has the tendency to have a local structural order and its presence is intrinsic and universal to any liquid. Such structural ordering is a consequence of many-body correlations, more specifically, bond angle correlations, which we believe are crucial for the description of the liquid state. We show that this physical picture may naturally explain difficult unsolved problems associated with the liquid state, such as anomalies of water-type liquids (water, Si, Ge, ...), liquid-liquid transition, liquid-glass transition, crystallization and quasicrystal formation, in a unified manner. In other words, we need a new order parameter representing a low local free-energy configuration, which is a bond orientational order parameter in many cases, in addition to a density order parameter for the physical description of these phenomena. Here we review our two-order-parameter model of liquid and consider how transient local structural ordering is linked to all of the above-mentioned phenomena. The relationship between these phenomena is also discussed.Graphical abstract Open image in new window},

  abstract = {This chapter focuses primarily on corrections to the thermodynamic model of nucleation theory. Density-functional theories (DFT) indicate that the cluster/parent phase interface is broad, that the properties of small clusters are not the same as those of macroscopic pieces of the new phase, and that unless the phase transformation occurs near equilibrium, the classical-theory calculation of the work of cluster formation is incorrect. Close to equilibrium, a critical fluctuation of the new phase resembles the critical nucleus in classical nucleation theory (CNT) in various ways: (1) the order parameter (such as the density) at the center of the nucleus approaches the equilibrium value for the new phase, (2) the specific energy associated with the interface approaches that of a flat interface, (3) the size of the fluctuation (corresponding to the cluster radius) is very large, (4) the thickness of the interface is small compared with the size of the fluctuation, and (5) the work of formation for the fluctuation is in reasonable agreement with predictions from CNT.},

Three approaches are considered to incorporate foreign walls of tunable wetting properties into phase field simulations: a continuum realization of the classical spherical cap model (called model A herein), a nonclassical approach (model B) that leads to ordering of the liquid at the wall and to the appearance of a surface spinodal, and a nonclassical model (model C) that allows for the appearance of local states at the wall that are accessible in the bulk phases only via thermal fluctuations. We illustrate the potential of the presented phase field methods for describing complex polycrystalline solidification morphologies including the shish-kebab structure, columnar to equiaxed transition, and front-particle interaction in binary alloys.},

  abstract = {Phase-field modelling, as it is understood today, is still a young discipline in condensed matter physics, which established itself for that class of systems in condensed matter physics, which can be characterized by domains of different phases separated by a distinct interface. Driven out of equilibrium, their dynamics results in the evolution of those interfaces, during which those might develop into well-defined structures with characteristic length scales at the nano-, micro- or mesoscale. Since the material properties of such systems are, to a large extent, determined by those small-scale structures, acquiring a precise understanding of the mechanisms that drive the interfacial dynamics is a great challenge for scientists in this field. Phase-field modelling is an approach that allows us to tackle this challenge simulation-based. This overview summarizes briefly the essentials of the conceptual background of the phase-field method, as well as recent issues the phase-field community is focusing on, as far as they are related to nucleation. To that end a brief introduction to the basic understanding underlying the diffuse interface description, which is the conceptual backbone of phase-field modelling, is given at the beginning, followed by a detailed picture of its achievements so far in applications to nucleation phenomena in metals and colloids. Within the most relevant fields of condensed matter physics, approached by phase-field modelling until now, applications to metallic systems are a traditional domain of phase-field modelling and nucleation phenomena therein have been addressed by several groups. This paper provides an overview of these. Advances in the field of colloidal systems, on the other hand, are only more recent and are addressed here in the context of contributions to soft matter physics in general.},

This paper focuses on improving the performance of the phase-field model of which the vacancy concentration is used as the single conserved order parameter. Following recent developments in these phase-field models, the void dynamic, or more precisely the void growth rate which plays a vital role in characterizing the microstructural evolution of irradiated materials, cannot be accurately reproduced. Moreover, the interfacial energy or the void-matrix interface modeled by the Ginzburg-type gradient energy term is usually characterized by an empirical coefficient that is quite difficult to determine. For these reasons, a general relation of the bulk free energy density, the coefficient of the gradient energy term and the interface width is analytically derived from the planar interface case, and then validated by the numerical simulation example of a single void evolution in molybdenum (Mo). The obtained void growth rate agrees well with the prediction of rate theory while the interface width is smaller than a critical value in the considered cases regardless of the shape of the free energy density. This study will not only help to construct the appropriate formulation of the bulk free energy density, but will also provide an easy method of calculating the corresponding gradient energy coefficient and selecting the grid size according to the pre-estimated interface width.},

In the present work, we model the process of nucleation and growth using a combination of classical nucleation and phase-field theory. A diffusion coupled phase-field model is used to evaluate the work of formation and the growth behavior of the critical nucleus. The results are combined with classical nucleation and JMAK theory in order to estimate the glass forming ability of the compositions Cu64Zr36,Cu10Zr7 and CuZr2 in terms of TTT-diagrams and critical cooling rates. It is found that the work of formation of the critical nucleus from the phase-field theory agrees with the classical theory when the critical size is larger than the width of the solid-liquid interface. At smaller critical sizes, the work of formation deviates approximately linearly between the two theories. Furthermore, it is shown that the growth behavior from the phase-field simulations agree with analytical expressions of the growth rate from the classical theory.},

Besides simpler cases of homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation, phenomena addressed by these techniques include precursor assisted nucleation, nucleation in eutectic and phase separating systems, phase selection via competing nucleation processes, growth front nucleation (a process, in which grains of new orientations form at the solidification front) yielding crystal sheaves and spherulites, and transition between the growth controlled cellular and the nucleation dominated equiaxial solidification morphologies.},

B 75, 064107 (2007)] to study the effect of the curved, diffuse solid-liquid interface on the interfacial energy as well as the nucleation barrier. The calculation of the interfacial energy and the nucleation barrier certainly depends on the proper definition of the solid-liquid dividing surface and the corresponding nucleus size. We define the position of the sharp interface at which the interfacial energy is to be evaluated by using the concept of equimolar dividing surface (re) and the minimization of the interfacial energy (rs). The comparison of the results based on both radii shows that the difference re−rs is always positive and has a limit for large cluster sizes which is comparable to the Tolman length. Furthermore, we found the real nucleation barrier for small cluster sizes, which is defined as a function of the radius rs, and compared it with the classical nucleation theory. The simulation results also show that the extracted interfacial energy as function of both radii is independent of system size, and this dependence can be reasonably described by the nonclassical Tolman formula with a positive Tolman length.},

  abstract = {We apply a simple dynamical density functional theory, the phase-field crystal (PFC) model of overdamped conservative dynamics, to address polymorphism, crystal nucleation, and crystal growth in the diffusion-controlled limit. We refine the phase diagram for 3D, and determine the line free energy in 2D and the height of the nucleation barrier in 2D and 3D for homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation by solving the respective Euler–Lagrange (EL) equations. We demonstrate that, in the PFC model, the body-centered cubic (bcc), the face-centered cubic (fcc), and the hexagonal close-packed structures (hcp) compete, while the simple cubic structure is unstable, and that phase preference can be tuned by changing the model parameters: close to the critical point the bcc structure is stable, while far from the critical point the fcc prevails, with an hcp stability domain in between. We note that with increasing distance from the critical point the equilibrium shapes vary from the sphere to specific faceted shapes: rhombic dodecahedron (bcc), truncated octahedron (fcc), and hexagonal prism (hcp). Solving the equation of motion of the PFC model supplied with conserved noise, solidification starts with the nucleation of an amorphous precursor phase, into which the stable crystalline phase nucleates. The growth rate is found to be time dependent and anisotropic; this anisotropy depends on the driving force. We show that due to the diffusion-controlled growth mechanism, which is especially relevant for crystal aggregation in colloidal systems, dendritic growth structures evolve in large-scale isothermal single-component PFC simulations. An oscillatory effective pair potential resembling those for model glass formers has been evaluated from structural data of the amorphous phase obtained by instantaneous quenching. Finally, we present results for eutectic solidification in a binary PFC model.},

This growth mode, termed GC (glass-crystal), is so fast that it is not limited by molecular diffusion in the bulk liquid. We have studied the GC mode by growing seven polymorphs from the liquid of ROY, currently the top system for the number of coexisting polymorphs of known structures. Some polymorphs did not show GC growth, while others did, with the latter having higher density and more isotropic molecular packing. The polymorphs not showing GC growth grew as compact spherulites at all temperatures; their growth rates near Tg decreased smoothly with falling temperature. The polymorphs showing GC growth changed growth morphologies with temperature, from faceted single crystals near the melting points, to fiber-like crystals near Tg, and to compact spherulites in the GC mode; in the GC mode, they grew at rates 3−4 orders of magnitude faster with activation energies 2-fold smaller than the polymorphs not showing GC growth. The GC mode had rates and activation energies similar to those of a polymorphic transformation observed near Tg. The GC mode was disrupted by the onset of the liquid's structural relaxation but could persist well above Tg (up to 1.15 Tg) in the form of fast-growing fibers. We consider various explanations for the GC mode and suggest that it is solid-state transformation enabled by local molecular motions native to the glassy state and disrupted by the liquid's structural relaxation (the α process).},

  abstract = {We have recently shown that 5\% CO2/95\% O2 in the serosal bathing solution, with 100\% O2 in the mucosal solution, results in CO2-diffusion limitation of acid secretion in bullfrog gastric mucosa. Changing to 10\% CO2/90\% 02 on both surfaces doubles the acid secretory rate. We calculate that, were the rate of oxygen consumption to increase significantly as a result of secretory stimulation, the tissue would now be oxygen limited. This prediction is tested by raising the P02 by increasing the total pressure in a hyperbaric chamber. Since no change in acid secretory rate or potential difference was observed upon changing from PO2 = 0.9 to PO2 = 1.9 atm, we conclude that the tissue is not O2 limited at normal pressure. Decreasing PO2 below 0.9 atm, by contrast, decreases the acid secretory rate and raises both PD and resistance. We infer that the rate of oxygen consumption did not rise significantly when acid secretion was increased by supplying sufficient CO2.},

Both unperturbed 2D films and films on a model graphite substrate are investigated; in the latter case the fluid parameters are chosen to model methane. Large systems are used, up to 8000 molecules in the case of the unperturbed 2D films. Finite-size effects are accounted for in the region near the critical point, and the critical temperatures and densities are estimated for both systems. For the unperturbed 2D LJ films we find the reduced critical temperature and density to be T*c = 0·498 ± 0·002, and ρ*c = 0·360 ± 0·005. The corresponding values for the monolayer film on graphite are T*c = 0·500 ± 0·002, and ρ*c = 0·368 ± 0·005. The influence of the graphite substrate on the coexistence curve is found to be small, as expected. Comparisons of the simulated coexistence curve with experimental data for methane on graphite show good agreement in the critical region, and for the coexisting liquid phase densities, but the simulated gas phase densities are smaller than experimental values.},

Experimental 1H and/or 13C NMR spectral data and its proper interpretation for the compound of interest is required as a starting point. The approach involves the following steps: (i) using molecular mechanics calculations (with, e.g., MacroModel) to generate a library of conformers; (ii) using density functional theory (DFT) calculations (with, e.g., Gaussian 09) to determine optimal geometry, free energies and chemical shifts for each conformer; (iii) determining Boltzmann-weighted proton and carbon chemical shifts; and (iv) comparing the computed chemical shifts for two or more candidate structures with experimental data to determine the best fit. For a typical structure assignment of a small organic molecule (e.g., fewer than ∼10 non-H atoms or up to ∼180 a.m.u. and ∼20 conformers), this protocol can be completed in ∼2 h of active effort over a 2-d period; for more complex molecules (e.g., fewer than ∼30 non-H atoms or up to ∼500 a.m.u. and ∼50 conformers), the protocol requires ∼3–6 h of active effort over a 2-week period. To demonstrate the method, we have chosen the analysis of the cis- versus the trans-diastereoisomers of 3-methylcyclohexanol (1-cis versus 1-trans). The protocol is written in a manner that makes the computation of chemical shifts tractable for chemists who may otherwise have only rudimentary computational experience.},

This identification and the location of the transition is in good agreement with that obtained from an analysis of the free energies of the fluid and solid phases. Equilibration problems are found in the solid phase and the melting of a defective solid is also investigated. The behavior of the pair distribution function, angular correlation function, diffusion constant, and the defect structure uncovered by an analysis of nearest-neighbor polygons is generally consistent with a first-order mechanism. Evidence for direct fluid-solid coexistence is presented. However, a very small fluid-solid interface tension is indicated, and there is a rapid growth in the range of correlations in the fluid near freezing. The behavior of the elastic constants at melting is in fairly good agreement with the Halperin-Nelson melting criterion.},

The "unperturbed" potential, which is homogeneous in the coordinates of the interacting particles, has trivial scaling properties which greatly simplify the computations. The attractive perturbation is treated to first order; the second-order corrections are shown to be very small at not-too-low temperatures. A high-temperature equation of state is obtained for the Lennard-Jones fluid, which is in excellent agreement with exact Monte Carlo computations at temperatures as low as about twice the critical temperature. Using the Hoover-Ree scheme, the free energy of the solid is determined and the transition densities and pressures calculated in the first-order approximation, which is shown to be quite satisfactory.

We first made calculations using liquid-state perturbation theory for the fluid state and a self-consistent cell theory for the solid state to determine thermodynamic functions; these results led to ordinary first-order phase transitions between solid/fluid and liquid/gas phases, in agreement with the constant-pressure Monte Carlo results of Abraham. We refined the calculations by using constant-pressure and constant-density Monte Carlo results to improve the accuracy of the calculated free energies, and we determined the two-phase equilibria by making direct Monte Carlo calculations for two-phase systems. The results are internally consistent and lead to a phase diagram qualitatively similar to the three-dimensional Lennard-Jones system.
Résumé
La nature de la transition fusion/solidification pour un système bidimensionel de molécules avec des interactions représentées par des potentiels Lennard-Jones 6:12, qui constitue un prototype des systèmes physisorbés, a suscité récemment beaucoup d'intérêt. C'est pourquoi nous avons fait une étude détaillée de la thermodynamique du diagramme des phases pour ce système. Nous avons d'abord fait des calculs, en utilisant la théorie des pertubations de l'état liquide dans le cas de l'état fluide, et une théorie cellulaire self-consistante dans le cas de l'état solide, pour déterminer les fonctions thermodynamiques; ces résultats ont conduit à des transitions de phase ordinaires du premier ordre entre les phases solide/fluide et liquide/gaz, en accord avec les résultats Monte Carlo à pression constante de Abraham. Nous avons raffiné les calculs en utilisant des résultats Monte Carlo à pression constante et à densité constante pour améliorer la précision des énergies libres calculées, et nous avons déterminé les équilibres à deux phases en faisant des calculs Monte Carlo directs pour les systèmes à deux phases. Les résultats sont cohérents et conduisent à un diagramme des phases qualitativement semblable à celui du système Lennard-Jones tridimensionnel.},

Even for the fundamental hard-disk model, the melting mechanism has not been agreed upon after 50 years of studies. A recent Monte Carlo algorithm allows us to thermalize systems large enough to access the thermodynamic regime. We show that melting in hard disks proceeds in two steps with a liquid phase, a hexatic phase, and a solid. The hexatic-solid transition is continuous while, surprisingly, the liquid-hexatic transition is of first order. This melting scenario solves one of the fundamental statistical-physics models, which is at the root of a large body of theoretical, computational, and experimental research.},

This has remained a formidable task, despite a plethora of existing clustering methods. We present InfleCS, a novel method for extracting well-defined core states from free energy landscapes. The method is based on a Gaussian mixture free energy estimator and exploits the shape of the estimated density landscape. The core states that naturally arise from the clustering allow for detailed characterization of the conformational ensemble. The clustering quality is evaluated on three toy models with different properties, where the method is shown to consistently outperform other conventional and state-of-the-art clustering methods. Finally, the method is applied to a temperature enhanced molecular dynamics simulation of Ca2+-bound Calmodulin. Through the free energy landscape, we discover a pathway between a canonical and a compact state, revealing conformational changes driven by electrostatic interactions.},

  abstract = {We have measured in situ Raman spectra of SiO2 glass between room temperature through the glass transformation range to the supercooled liquid at 1950 K, using a new wire loop heating technique. These results provide valuable insights into the structural and dynamic behaviour of this prototype silicate system at magmatic temperatures. The principal low frequency Raman band in the glass shows an anomalous increase in frequency with increasing temperature, indicating that the average SiOSi angle narrows as temperature is increased, due to anharmonic vibrational effects. Configurational changes at temperatures above Tg result in further increases in the band frequency. These effects are responsible for the anomalous volume behaviour of SiO2 glass and supercooled liquid with increasing temperature, including the low thermal expansivity over most of the temperature range, and the occurrence of density maxima at low and high temperatures. From experiments on glasses with different fictive temperatures, there is an increase in the intensity of the 606 cm−1 band, due to an increase in the proportion of three-membered ring “defect” species in the glass above Tg. This indicates that structural relaxation in the liquid state is accompanied by Si — O — Si bond breaking and reforming reactions, consistent with the measured magnitude of the activation energy for viscous flow. This observation is combined with recent results on the mechanism of structural relaxation in silicate liquids to propose an energetic model for viscous relaxation in SiO2, involving O2− transfer via formation of a vSi intermediate. This model is then generalized to ternary aluminosilicate systems, to provide a rationalization for the observed viscosity maximum at constant silica content, in high silica rock-forming melt compositions.},

This model, introduced by Lewis and Wahnström in 1993, collapses each phenyl ring to a single interaction site; the intermolecular site-site interactions are described by the Lennard-Jones potential whose parameters have been selected to reproduce some bulk properties of the orthoterphenyl molecule. A system of N=343 molecules is considered in a wide range of densities and temperatures, reaching simulation times up to 1μs. Such long trajectories allow us to equilibrate the system at temperatures below the mode coupling temperature Tc at which the diffusion constant reaches values of order 10−10cm2/s and thereby to sample in a significant way the potential energy landscape in the entire temperature range. Working within the inherent structures thermodynamic formalism, we present results for the temperature and density dependence of the number, depth and shape of the basins of the potential energy surface. We evaluate the total entropy of the system by thermodynamic integration from the ideal—noninteracting—gas state and the vibrational entropy approximating the basin free energy with the free energy of 6N−3 harmonic oscillators. We evaluate the configurational part of the entropy as a difference between these two contributions. We study the connection between thermodynamical and dynamical properties of the system. We confirm that the temperature dependence of the configurational entropy and of the diffusion constant, as well as the inverse of the characteristic structural relaxation time, are strongly connected in supercooled states; we demonstrate that this connection is well represented by the Adam-Gibbs relation, stating a linear relation between logD and the quantity 1/TSc. This relation is found to hold both above and below the critical temperature Tc—as previously found in the case of silica—supporting the hypothesis that a connection exists between the number of basins and the connectivity properties of the potential energy surface.},

The molecule is described by a simple rigid three-site model, with interactions between different molecules of the Lennard-Jones form. We find that the long-time (α) relaxation, as determined from the intermediate scattering function, is well described by a Kohlrausch law. The zero-time amplitude of this process, often referred to as the ‘‘nonergodicity parameter,’’ which can be interpreted as a Debye-Waller factor, is seen to depart from a linear temperature dependence and seems to exhibit a ‘‘singularity’’ at a temperature substantially larger than the conventional glass transition temperature, in accord with neutron-scattering data, and as predicted by mode-coupling theory. We find that the observed anharmonic behavior around Tc, as well as the decay of the scattering functions, is equally evident from both orientational and translational correlations. The latter observation indicates that the structural changes that take place during α relaxation are neither specifically orientational nor specifically translational. Investigation of the van Hove self-correlation for both center-of-mass and orientational motion reveals the existence of a strong non-Gaussian spatial dependence at intermediate times and of processes, even at low temperatures, that cannot be described as simple vibrational motion, and which consist of rapid reorientations of the molecules about their essentially frozen centers of mass. This motion may be related to the fast secondary mode seen in experiments.},

Finally, we sample the potential energy landscape of the model and show that it displays hierarchical ordering. Substructures in the landscape, which may correspond to metabasins, have boundaries defined by cage-breaking transitions.

Using molecular dynamics simulations, we examine how varying θ0 affects their thermal solidification. By examining trends with θ0, comparing these to the trends in trimers’ jamming phenomenology, and then focusing on the six θ0 that are commensurable with close-packed crystalline order, we obtain three key results: (i) the increase in trimers’ solidification temperature Ts(θ0) as they straighten (as θ0 → 0°) is driven by the same gradual loss of effective configurational freedom that drives athermal trimers’ decreasing ϕJ(θ0) [where ϕJ(θ0) is the packing fraction at jamming]; (ii) θ0 that allow formation of both FCC and HCP order crystallize, while θ0 that only allow formation of HCP order glass-form; and (iii) local cluster-level structure at temperatures slightly above Ts(θ0) is highly predictive of whether trimers will crystallize or glass-form.},

  abstract = {Dynamic relaxation is an intrinsic and universal feature of glasses and enables fluctuation and dissipation to occur, which induces plentiful behaviour, maintains equilibrium, and achieves evolution in glass systems. Relaxation covers a broad time, frequency, and temperature ranges and determines the functions, behaviour, properties and applications of glassy system. Investigations of dynamic relaxation are significant for understanding the nature of glasses, liquids, and the critical issues of glass formation and transition, dynamic and structural heterogeneities, flow behaviour and flow units, various crossover temperatures, deformations, aging and rejuvenation, stability, crystallization, and the mechanical and physical properties of glasses. Metallic glasses (MGs) with unique microstructure and mechanical and functional properties, offer a simple but effective system for study of relaxation and related issues in glass science. In this review, a panoramic view of the state of the art of various aspects of dynamic relaxation in metallic glassy system, as well as a comparison with other glassy systems, is presented. The features and mechanisms of each known relaxation mode including primary α-relaxation, slow and fast 7 β-relaxations, nearly constant loss, and boson peak, as well as their coupling in MGs, are reviewed and summarized. Emphasis is presented to the microstructural origin of these dynamic relaxation modes and their connection with the dynamic and structural heterogeneities in MGs. The factors which determine and affect the relaxation modes and behaviour in low-dimensional MGs are also introduced. It is shown that the relaxation in MGs is connected with their structural characteristics, heterogeneity, formation, glass transition, flow behaviour, physical and mechanical properties, crystallization, stability, and the localized atomic diffusion. The roles and the importance of dynamic relaxation in understanding many crucial issues in glassy physics are demonstrated. The correlations between dynamic relaxation and various properties of MGs are established and summarized. With this review on dynamic relaxation in metallic glasses, relaxation in MG can provide an effective perspective for understanding nearly all issues in metallic glasses. It is demonstrated that the relationship of relaxation to various properties, similar to the relationship of structure–property of crystalline materials, can be applied to control and design of new glassy materials with multiple functionalities, superior mechanical performance, and other extraordinary physical and chemical properties. Finally, the key unsolved questions regarding dynamic relaxation in metallic glasses are listed, and several emerging research directions in this still-evolving field are highlighted for future investigations.},

  abstract = {Jammed particulate systems composed of various shapes of particles undergo the jamming transition as they are compressed or decompressed. To date, sphere packings have been extensively studied in many previous works, where isostaticity at the transition and scaling laws with the pressure of various quantities, including the contact number and the vibrational density of states, have been established. Additionally, much attention has been paid to nonspherical packings, and particularly recent work has made progress in understanding ellipsoidal packings. In this work, we study the dimer packings in two dimensions, which have been much less understood than systems of spheres and ellipsoids. We first study the contact number of dimers near the jamming transition. It turns out that packings of dimers have “rotational rattlers,” each of which still has a free rotational motion. After correcting this effect, we show that dimers become isostatic at the jamming, and the excess contact number obeys the same critical law and finite-size scaling law as those of spheres. We next study the vibrational properties of dimers near the transition. We find that the vibrational density of states of dimers exhibits two characteristic plateaus that are separated by a peak. The high-frequency plateau is dominated by the translational degree of freedom, while the low-frequency plateau is dominated by the rotational degree of freedom. We establish the critical scaling laws of the characteristic frequencies of the plateaus and the peak near the transition. In addition, we present detailed characterizations of the real space displacement fields of vibrational modes in the translational and rotational plateaus.},

  abstract = {The glass transition – an apparent amorphous solidification process – is a central feature of the physical properties of soft materials such as polymers and colloids. A key element of this phenomenon is the observation of a broad spectrum of deviations from an Arrhenius temperature of dynamics in glass-forming liquids, with the extent of deviation quantified by the “fragility” of glass formation. The underlying origin of “fragile” glass formation and its dependence on molecular structure remain major open questions in condensed matter physics and soft materials science. Here we employ molecular dynamics simulations, together with a neural-network-biased genetic algorithm, to design and study model rigid molecules spanning a broad range of fragilities of glass formation. Results indicate that fragility of glass formation can be controlled by tuning molecular asphericity, with extended molecules tending to exhibit low fragilities and compact molecules tending toward higher fragilities. The glass transition temperature itself, on the other hand, correlates well with high-temperature activation behavior and with density. These results point the way towards rational design of glass-forming liquids spanning a range of dynamical behavior, both via these physical insights and via future extensions of this evolutionary design strategy to real chemistries. Finally, we show that results compare well with predictions of the nonlinear Langevin theory of liquid dynamics, which is a precursor of the more recently developed elastically collective nonlinear Langevin equation theory of Mirigian and Schweizer, identifying this framework as a promising basis for molecular design of the glass transition.},

In this paper, we present what we believe to be the first full-scale FPGA-based simulation engine, and show that its performance is competitive with a GPU (running Amber in an industrial production environment). The system features on-chip particle data storage and management, short- and long-range force evaluation, as well as bonded forces, motion update, and particle migration. Other contributions of this work include exploring numerous architectural trade-offs and analysis on various mappings schemes among particles/cells and the various on-chip compute units. The potential impact is that this system promises to be the basis for long timescale Molecular Dynamics with a commodity cluster.},

We first introduce the algorithms and computational methods used in MD and describe the general issues in accelerating MD. In the core of this chapter, we show how to design an efficient force computation pipeline for the range-limited force computation, the most time-consuming part of MD and the most mature topic in FPGA acceleration of MD. We discuss computational techniques and simulation quality and present efficient filtering and mapping schemes. We also discuss overall design, host–accelerator interaction and other board-level issues. We conclude with future challenges and the potential of production FPGA-accelerated MD.},

  abstract = {The breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation between diffusivity and viscosity at low temperatures is considered to be one of the hallmarks of glassy dynamics in liquids. Theoretical analyses relate this breakdown with the presence of heterogeneous dynamics, and by extension, with the fragility of glass formers. We perform an investigation of the breakdown of the SE relation in 2, 3, and 4 dimensions in order to understand these interrelations. Results from simulations of model glass formers show that the degree of the breakdown of the SE relation decreases with increasing spatial dimensionality. The breakdown itself can be rationalized via the difference between the activation free energies for diffusivity and viscosity (or relaxation times) in the Adam-Gibbs relation in three and four dimensions. The behavior in two dimensions also can be understood in terms of a generalized Adam-Gibbs relation that is observed in previous work. We calculate various measures of heterogeneity of dynamics and find that the degree of the SE breakdown and measures of heterogeneity of dynamics are generally well correlated but with some exceptions. The two-dimensional systems we study show deviations from the pattern of behavior of the three- and four-dimensional systems both at high and low temperatures. The fragility of the studied liquids is found to increase with spatial dimensionality, contrary to the expectation based on the association of fragility with heterogeneous dynamics.},

With ultrahigh static field gradients up to ≈ 180 T/m, a prototype of which has recently been installed in Mainz, Q-values up to {$>$} 10−2 Å−1 become accessible. The first part of the paper focusses on details of this technical development and points out the close analogy with incoherent neutron scattering. In the second part, the enormous new possibilities of this kind of gradient NMR are demonstrated through a collection of most recent applications: the measurement of small self-diffusion coefficients down to about 10−15 m2s−1 in supercooled liquids and in molecular crystals, long chain polymer dynamics, restricted diffusion in systems of confined mesocopic geometries and anomalous diffusion on fractal structures.},

Rotational correlation times from 10-10 to 103 s were measured in the temperature range from 341 to 515 K (Tg = 343.5 K). Translational diffusion coefficients ranged from 10-6 to 10-15 cm2/s over a similar temperature range. The rotational correlation times of all probes have essentially the same temperature dependence as the viscosity of TNB. In contrast, the translational diffusion of the smallest probe, tetracene, is observed to have a significantly weaker temperature dependence. At Tg, the translational diffusion coefficient of tetracene is 300 times larger than expected based on its rotational correlation time. Similar enhancements of translational diffusion near Tg have recently been observed in other glass-forming liquids. These observations suggest that dynamics in TNB and other supercooled liquids are spatially heterogeneous. The probes used in this study were tetracene, rubrene, 9,10-diphenylanthracene, and 9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene.},

Using a short extrapolation procedure, good agreement is obtained between the empirical representation and the experimental curves for the α relaxation in polyethyl acrylate. It is suggested that the present representation would have a general application to the α relaxations in other polymers.

  abstract = {Molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations have been carried out on a two-component Lennard-Jones system, quenched into supercooled and amorphous states. Two different regimes of viscous behavior are found in the time window accessible in MD simulation studies (of the order of nanoseconds if units appropriate for argon are used). The results for the time dependence of the self-intermediate scattering function Fs(q,t) show two different slow relaxation processes, where the slowest (α relaxation) can be represented by a stretched exponential, exp[-(t/τrel)β]. In the frequency domain this gives rise to a quasielastic peak, and it is found that its area, the nonergodicity parameter fs(q)==a, shows an anomalous decrease when increasing the temperature towards a critical value Tc. This happens in the supercooled-liquid regime, and it is one of the basic predictions of the recent mode-coupling theory for the liquid-glass transition problem. In the strongly supercooled-liquid regime the diffusion is of the hopping type, and it is found to be strongly cooperative in nature.},

The pair-correlation function and the constant of self-diffusion are found to agree well with experiment; the latter is 15\% lower than the experimental value. The spectrum of the velocity autocorrelation function shows a broad maximum in the frequency region ω=0.25(kBTℏ). The shape of the Van Hove function Gs(r, t) attains a maximum departure from a Gaussian at about t=3.0×10−12 sec and becomes a Gaussian again at about 10−11 sec. The Van Hove function Gd(r, t) has been compared with the convolution approximation of Vineyard, showing that this approximation gives a too rapid decay of Gd(r, t) with time. A delayed-convolution approximation has been suggested which gives a better fit with Gd(r, t); this delayed convolution makes Gd(r, t) decay as t4 at short times and as t at long times.},

Single molecule orientational correlation times show this strong Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann temperature dependence typical for glasses. Through statistical analysis of single molecule trajectories, we can identify individual glass rearrangement events in the vicinity of a probe molecule in the glass former poly(vinyl acetate) from 8 K below to 6 K above the glass transition temperature. We find that changes in the distribution of waiting times between individual glass rearrangement events are much less dramatic with temperature, the main difference being a small, but decisive number of increasingly long waiting times at lower temperatures. We notice similar individual, local relaxation events in molecular dynamics trajectories for a variety of glassy systems further from the glass transition, leading to waiting time distributions with similar features as those observed in the single molecule experiments. We show that these rare long waiting times are responsible for the dramatic increase in correlation time upon cooling.},

  abstract = {In V-T theory the atomic motion is harmonic vibrations in a liquid-specific potential energy valley, plus transits, which move the system rapidly among the multitude of such valleys. In its first application to the self intermediate scattering function (SISF), V-T theory produced an accurate account of molecular dynamics (MD) data at all wave numbers q and time t. Recently, analysis of the mean square displacement (MSD) resolved a crossover behavior that was not observed in the SISF study. Our purpose here is to apply the more accurate MSD calibration to the SISF, and assess the results. We derive and discuss the theoretical equations for vibrational and transit contributions to the SISF. The time evolution is divided into three successive intervals: the vibrational interval when the vibrational contribution alone accurately accounts for the MD data; the crossover when the vibrational contribution saturates and the transit contribution becomes resolved; and the diffusive interval when the transit contribution alone accurately accounts for the MD data. The resulting theoretical error is extremely small at all q and t. V-T theory is compared to mode-coupling theories for the MSD and SISF, and to recent developments in Brownian motion experiments and theory.},

  abstract = {We study the dynamical behaviour of a computer model for viscous silica, the archetypal strong glass former, and compare its diffusion mechanism with earlier studies of a fragile binary Lennard-Jones liquid. Three different methods of analysis are employed. First, the temperature and time scale dependence of the diffusion constant is analysed. Negative correlation of particle displacements influences transport properties in silica as well as in fragile liquids. We suggest that the difference between Arrhenius and super-Arrhenius diffusive behaviour results from competition between the correlation time scale and the caging time scale. Second, we analyse the dynamics using a geometrical definition of cage-breaking transitions that was proposed previously for fragile glass formers. We find that this definition accurately captures the bond rearrangement mechanisms that control transport in open network liquids, and reproduces the diffusion constants accurately at low temperatures. As the same method is applicable to both strong and fragile glass formers, we can compare correlation time scales in these two types of systems. We compare the time spent in chains of correlated cage breaks with the characteristic caging time and find that correlations in the fragile binary Lennard-Jones system persist for an order of magnitude longer than those in the strong silica system. We investigate the origin of the correlation behaviour by sampling the potential energy landscape for silica and comparing it with the binary Lennard-Jones model. We find no qualitative difference between the landscapes, but several metrics suggest that the landscape of the fragile liquid is rougher and more frustrated. Metabasins in silica are smaller than those in binary Lennard-Jones and contain fewer high-barrier processes. This difference probably leads to the observed separation of correlation and caging time scales.},

Treating the high dimensionality of molecular and condensed matter systems of contemporary interest is important for understanding how emergent properties are encoded in the landscape and for calculating these properties while faithfully representing barriers between different morphologies. The pathways characterized in full dimensionality, which are used to construct kinetic transition networks, may prove useful in guiding such calculations. The energy landscape perspective has also produced new procedures for structure prediction and analysis of thermodynamic properties. Basin-hopping global optimization, with alternative acceptance criteria and generalizations to multiple metric spaces, has been used to treat systems ranging from biomolecules to nanoalloy clusters and condensed matter.

  abstract = {.From equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a bead-spring model for short-chain glass-forming polymer melts we calculate several quantities characterizing the single-monomer dynamics near the (extrapolated) critical temperature 𝑇cTcT\_\{\textbackslash{}rm c\} of mode-coupling theory: the mean-square displacement g0(t), the non-Gaussian parameter 𝛼2(𝑡)α2(t) \textbackslash{}alpha\_\{2\}(t) and the self-part of the van Hove function 𝐺s(𝑟,𝑡)Gs(r,t) G\_\{\textbackslash{}rm s\}(r,t) which measures the distribution of monomer displacements r in time t. We also determine these quantities from a continuous-time random walk (CTRW) approach. The CTRW is defined in terms of various probability distributions which we know from previous analysis. Utilizing these distributions the CTRW can be solved numerically and compared to the MD data with no adjustable parameter. The MD results reveal the heterogeneous and non-Gaussian single-particle dynamics of the supercooled melt near 𝑇cTc T\_\{\textbackslash{}rm c\}. In the time window of the early 𝛼α\textbackslash{}alpha relaxation 𝛼2(𝑡)α2(t) \textbackslash{}alpha\_\{2\}(t) is large and 𝐺s(𝑟,𝑡)Gs(r,t) G\_\{\textbackslash{}rm s\}(r,t) is broad, reflecting the coexistence of monomer displacements that are much smaller (“slow particles”) and much larger (“fast particles”) than the average at time t, i.e. than 𝑟=𝑔0(𝑡)1/2r=g0(t)1/2 r = g\_\{0\}(t)\^\{1/2\}. For large r the tail of 𝐺s(𝑟,𝑡)Gs(r,t) G\_\{\textbackslash{}rm s\}(r,t) is compatible with an exponential decay, as found for many glassy systems. The CTRW can reproduce the spatiotemporal dependence of 𝐺s(𝑟,𝑡)Gs(r,t) G\_\{\textbackslash{}rm s\}(r,t) at a qualitative to semiquantitative level. However, it is not quantitatively accurate in the studied temperature regime, although the agreement with the MD data improves upon cooling. In the early 𝛼α\textbackslash{}alpha regime we also analyze the MD results for 𝐺s(𝑟,𝑡)Gs(r,t) G\_\{\textbackslash{}rm s\}(r,t) via the space-time factorization theorem predicted by ideal mode-coupling theory. While we find the factorization to be well satisfied for small r, both above and below 𝑇cTc T\_\{\textbackslash{}rm c\} , deviations occur for larger r comprising the tail of 𝐺s(𝑟,𝑡)Gs(r,t) G\_\{\textbackslash{}rm s\}(r,t). The CTRW analysis suggests that single-particle “hops” are a contributing factor for these deviations.Graphical abstract Open image in new window},

  abstract = {Key to resolving the scientific challenge of the glass transition is to understand the origin of the massive increase in viscosity of liquids cooled below their melting temperature (avoiding crystallisation). A number of competing and often mutually exclusive theoretical approaches have been advanced to describe this phenomenon. Some posit a bona fide thermodynamic phase to an ‘ideal glass’, an amorphous state with exceptionally low entropy. Other approaches are built around the concept of the glass transition as a primarily dynamic phenomenon. These fundamentally different interpretations give equally good descriptions of the data available, so it is hard to determine which—if any—is correct. Recently however this situation has begun to change. A consensus has emerged that one powerful means to resolve this longstanding question is to approach the putative thermodynamic transition sufficiently closely, and a number of techniques have emerged to meet this challenge. Here we review the results of some of these new techniques and discuss the implications for the existence—or otherwise—of the thermodynamic transition to an ideal glass.},

  abstract = {We use energy landscape methods to investigate the response of a supercooled liquid to random pinning. We classify the structural similarity of different energy minima using a measure of overlap. This analysis reveals a correspondence between distinct particle packings (which are characterised via the overlap) and funnels on the energy landscape (which are characterised via disconnectivity graphs). As the number of pinned particles is increased, we find a crossover from glassy behavior at low pinning to a structure-seeking landscape at high pinning, in which all thermally accessible minima are structurally similar. We discuss the consequences of these results for theories of randomly pinned liquids. We also investigate how the energy landscape depends on the fraction of pinned particles, including the degree of frustration and the evolution of distinct packings as the number of pinned particles is reduced.},

  abstract = {We study the relation of the potential energy landscape (PEL) topography to relaxation dynamics of a small model glass former of Lennard-Jones type. The mechanism under investigation is the hopping between superstructures of PEL minima, called metabasins (MBs). Guided by the idea that the mean durations 〈τ〉 of visits to MBs should reflect the local PEL structure, we first derive the effective depths of MBs from dynamics, by the relation Eapp=dln⟨τ⟩/dβ, where β=1/kBT. Second, we establish a connection of Eapp to the barriers that surround MBs. As the consequence of a rugged PEL, it turns out that escapes from MBs do not happen by single hops between PEL minima, but correspond to complicated multiminima sequences. We introduce the concept of return probabilities to the bottom of the MBs in order to judge when the attraction range of a MB has been left. The energy barriers overcome can then be identified. These turn out to be in good agreement with the effective depths Eapp, calculated from dynamics. We are thus able to relate MB lifetimes to their local structure. Moreover, we can trace back the overall diffusive dynamics to the population of MBs and to their local topology, i.e., to purely thermodynamic and structural quantities. Single energy barriers are identified with the help of a new method, which accurately performs a descent along the ridge between two minima. We analyze the population of transition regions between minima, called basin borders. No indication for the mechanism of diffusion to change around the mode-coupling temperature can be found. We discuss the question whether the one-dimensional reaction paths connecting two minima are relevant for the calculation of reaction rates at the temperatures under study.},

Here we examine the barriers and cage-breaking rearrangements that are pertinent to long-term diffusion. Single-step cage-breaking processes, which follow high-barrier routes, are identified, and different methods and criteria for defining a cage-breaking process are considered. We examine the extent to which a description of cage-breaking within the energy landscape is a description of long-term diffusion. This description includes the identification of cage-breaks that are reversed, and those that are productive towards long-term diffusion. At low temperatures, diffusion is adequately described by productive cage-breaks, or by considering all cage-breaks and accounting for the effect of reversals. To estimate the diffusion constant we require only the mean square displacement of a cage-break, the average waiting time for a cage-break, and a measure of the number of reversed cage-breaks. Cage-breaks can be visualized within the potential energy landscape using disconnectivity graphs, and we compare the use of productive cage-breaks with previous definitions of “megabasins” or “metabasins.”},

NAMD scales to hundreds of processors on high-end parallel platforms, as well as tens of processors on low-cost commodity clusters, and also runs on individual desktop and laptop computers. NAMD works with AMBER and CHARMM potential functions, parameters, and file formats. This article, directed to novices as well as experts, first introduces concepts and methods used in the NAMD program, describing the classical molecular dynamics force field, equations of motion, and integration methods along with the efficient electrostatics evaluation algorithms employed and temperature and pressure controls used. Features for steering the simulation across barriers and for calculating both alchemical and conformational free energy differences are presented. The motivations for and a roadmap to the internal design of NAMD, implemented in C++ and based on Charm++ parallel objects, are outlined. The factors affecting the serial and parallel performance of a simulation are discussed. Finally, typical NAMD use is illustrated with representative applications to a small, a medium, and a large biomolecular system, highlighting particular features of NAMD, for example, the Tcl scripting language. The article also provides a list of the key features of NAMD and discusses the benefits of combining NAMD with the molecular graphics/sequence analysis software VMD and the grid computing/collaboratory software BioCoRE.

We briefly discuss three different precision models developed specifically for this work (SPDP, SPFP, and DPDP) and highlight the technical details of the approach as it extends beyond previously reported work [Götz et al., J.

The code encompasses a minimal-communication domain decomposition algorithm, full dynamic load balancing, a state-of-the-art parallel constraint solver, and efficient virtual site algorithms that allow removal of hydrogen atom degrees of freedom to enable integration time steps up to 5 fs for atomistic simulations also in parallel. To improve the scaling properties of the common particle mesh Ewald electrostatics algorithms, we have in addition used a Multiple-Program, Multiple-Data approach, with separate node domains responsible for direct and reciprocal space interactions.

By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License.

The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl).

Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step.},

From the rigid body trajectory, we compute the translational and angular velocities of the molecule and by integration of the latter also the corresponding angular trajectory. All quantities can be referred to the laboratory frame and a molecule-fixed frame. The 6 × 6 diffusion tensor is computed from the asymptotic slope of the tensorial mean square displacement and, for comparison, also from the Kubo integral of the velocity correlation tensor. The method is illustrated for two simple model systems – a water molecule and a lysozyme molecule in bulk water. We give estimations of the statistical accuracy of the calculations.},

The studied thermodynamic states explore pressures and temperatures in the following ranges: 210–373 K (1 bar); 300–700 K (400, 1000, and 3000 bar), 277 K (1–6000 bar). Translation diffusion is also analyzed using the Einstein approach. The rotational diffusion is also characterized by computing the first and second order correlation times of the OH bond vectors and of the axes of inertia of the water molecule.},

  abstract = {We study by computer simulations, and by theory, the coupled rotational and translational dynamics of three important linear diatomic molecules, namely, carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), and cyanide ion (CN−) in water. Translational diffusion of these molecules is found to be strongly coupled to their own rotational dynamics which, in turn, are coupled to similar motions of the surrounding water. In particular, we find that coupled orientational jump motions play an important role in all three cases. While CO and NO show similar features, CN− exhibits certain differences. Our results agree well with the known experimental values of the diffusion coefficient. We examined the validity of hydrodynamic predictions and found them to be inadequate, particularly for rotational diffusion. A mode coupling theory approach is developed and applied to understand the complexity of translation-rotation coupling.},
