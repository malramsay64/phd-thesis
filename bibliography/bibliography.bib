Single molecule orientational correlation times show this strong Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann temperature dependence typical for glasses. Through statistical analysis of single molecule trajectories, we can identify individual glass rearrangement events in the vicinity of a probe molecule in the glass former poly(vinyl acetate) from 8 K below to 6 K above the glass transition temperature. We find that changes in the distribution of waiting times between individual glass rearrangement events are much less dramatic with temperature, the main difference being a small, but decisive number of increasingly long waiting times at lower temperatures. We notice similar individual, local relaxation events in molecular dynamics trajectories for a variety of glassy systems further from the glass transition, leading to waiting time distributions with similar features as those observed in the single molecule experiments. We show that these rare long waiting times are responsible for the dramatic increase in correlation time upon cooling.},

The algorithm is similar to SHAKE, which is one of the standard methods for performing such calculations. RATTLE calculates the positions and velocities at the next time from the positions and velocities at the present time step, without requiring information about the earlier history. Like SHAKE, it is based on the Verlet algorithm and retains the simplicity of using Cartesian coordinates for each of the atoms to describe the configuration of a molecule with internal constraints. RATTLE guarantees that the coordinates and velocities of the atoms in a molecule satisfy the internal constraints at each time step. RATTLE has two advantages over SHAKE. On computers of fixed precision, it is of higher precision than SHAKE. Since it deals directly with the velocities, it is easier to modify RATTLE for use with the recently developed constant temperature and constant pressure molecular dynamics methods and with the nonequilibrium molecular dynamics methods that make use of rescaling of the atomic velocities.},

  abstract = {The melting transition of two-dimensional systems is a fundamental problem in condensed matter and statistical physics that has advanced significantly through the application of computational resources and algorithms. Two-dimensional systems present the opportunity for novel phases and phase transition scenarios not observed in 3D systems, but these phases depend sensitively on the system and, thus, predicting how any given 2D system will behave remains a challenge. Here, we report a comprehensive simulation study of the phase behavior near the melting transition of all hard regular polygons with 3{$\leq$}n{$\leq$}14 vertices using massively parallel Monte Carlo simulations of up to 1\texttimes{}106 particles. By investigating this family of shapes, we show that the melting transition depends upon both particle shape and symmetry considerations, which together can predict which of three different melting scenarios will occur for a given n. We show that systems of polygons with as few as seven edges behave like hard disks; they melt continuously from a solid to a hexatic fluid and then undergo a first-order transition from the hexatic phase to the isotropic fluid phase. We show that this behavior, which holds for all 7{$\leq$}n{$\leq$}14, arises from weak entropic forces among the particles. Strong directional entropic forces align polygons with fewer than seven edges and impose local order in the fluid. These forces can enhance or suppress the discontinuous character of the transition depending on whether the local order in the fluid is compatible with the local order in the solid. As a result, systems of triangles, squares, and hexagons exhibit a Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) predicted continuous transition between isotropic fluid and triatic, tetratic, and hexatic phases, respectively, and a continuous transition from the appropriate x-atic to the solid. In particular, we find that systems of hexagons display continuous two-step KTHNY melting. In contrast, due to symmetry incompatibility between the ordered fluid and solid, systems of pentagons and plane-filling fourfold pentilles display a one-step first-order melting of the solid to the isotropic fluid with no intermediate phase.},

  abstract = {Glasses can be formed by many routes. In some cases, distinct polyamorphic forms are found. The normal mode of glass formation is cooling of a viscous liquid. Liquid behavior during cooling is classified between "strong" and "fragile," and the three canonical characteristics of relaxing liquids are correlated through the fragility. Strong liquids become fragile liquids on compression. In some cases, such conversions occur during cooling by a weak first-order transition. This behavior can be related to the polymorphism in a glass state through a recent simple modification of the van der Waals model for tetrahedrally bonded liquids. The sudden loss of some liquid degrees of freedom through such first-order transitions is suggestive of the polyamorphic transition between native and denatured hydrated proteins, which can be interpreted as single-chain glass-forming polymers plasticized by water and cross-linked by hydrogen bonds. The onset of a sharp change in d{$<$}r2{$>$}dT({$<$}r2{$>$} is the Debye-Waller factor and T is temperature) in proteins, which is controversially indentified with the glass transition in liquids, is shown to be general for glass formers and observable in computer simulations of strong and fragile ionic liquids, where it proves to be close to the experimental glass transition temperature. The latter may originate in strong anharmonicity in modes ("bosons"), which permits the system to access multiple minima of its configuration space. These modes, the Kauzmann temperature TK, and the fragility of the liquid, may thus be connected.},

  abstract = {The early stages of crystallization are not fully understood, a particularly challenging problem being crystallization from solution. The processes involved at an atomic level remain elusive to experiment. Furthermore, crystallization from solution has been thought to be inaccessible by atomistic computer simulations. This study demonstrates that crystallization from solution can in fact be simulated using the method of molecular dynamics for a model solute/solvent system consisting of atomic species characterized by the Lennard-Jones potential function. The model has been applied to look at the effects of varying supersaturation and of inclusion of a simple inhibitor in the system. The behavior of the model is in accord with experiment. In general, increasing supersaturation causes earlier onset of crystallization. Crystallization in highly supersaturated systems involves liquid-liquid phase separation followed by nucleation in the solute phase. The nucleation event in such systems does not appear to be influenced by the solvent. Inclusion of inhibitors retards the onset. Additionally, extensive solute clustering is observed. The crystallization model and variations on it, as well as step by step extension to realistic systems, should enable further testing and development of theory of crystal nucleation and growth and provide insights of technological importance.},

This article presents a practical convex hull algorithm that combines the two-dimensional Quickhull Algorithm with the general-dimension Beneath-Beyond Algorithm. It is similar to the randomized, incremental algorithms for convex hull and Delaunay triangulation. We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm runs faster when the input contains nonextreme points and that it uses less memory. Computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets are well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating-point arithmetic, this assumption can lead to serious errors. We briefly describe a solution to this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or four dimensions. The output is a set of ``thick '' facets that contain all possible exact convex hulls of the input. A variation is effective in five or more dimensions.},

We have therefore made a detailed study of the thermodynamics of the phase diagram for this system. We first made calculations using liquid-state perturbation theory for the fluid state and a self-consistent cell theory for the solid state to determine thermodynamic functions; these results led to ordinary first-order phase transitions between solid/fluid and liquid/gas phases, in agreement with the constant-pressure Monte Carlo results of Abraham. We refined the calculations by using constant-pressure and constant-density Monte Carlo results to improve the accuracy of the calculated free energies, and we determined the two-phase equilibria by making direct Monte Carlo calculations for two-phase systems. The results are internally consistent and lead to a phase diagram qualitatively similar to the three-dimensional Lennard-Jones system.

The intershell rotation and intershell diffusion transitions are investigated. The results are compared with Wigner crystallization in the infinite 2D system.},

A slowing down of the growth kinetics along the coexistence line is observed, which is due to the decrease of the melting enthalpy with increasing coexistence temperature and pressure. Other quantities such as the melting pressure and liquid self-diffusion coefficient have a comparatively lesser impact on the kinetic growth coefficient. Growth kinetics of the LJ and WCA potentials become similar at large values of the melting temperature and pressure, when both resemble a purely repulsive soft-sphere potential. Classical models of crystallization from the melt are in reasonable qualitative agreement with our simulation data. Finally, several one-phase empirical melting/freezing rules are studied with respect to their validity along the coexistence line.},

The k-d tree is defined and examples are given. It is shown to be quite efficient in its storage requirements. A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an n record file are: insertion, O(log n); deletion of the root, O(n(k-1)/k); deletion of a random node, O(log n); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches), O(n log n). Search algorithms are given for partial match queries with t keys specified [proven maximum running time of O(n(k-t)/k)] and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average running time of O(log n).] These performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms for these tasks. An algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query. The main focus of this paper is theoretical. It is felt, however, that k-d trees could be quite useful in many applications, and examples of potential uses are given.},

The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step.},

Our reinvestigation of this puzzle with modern instrumentation has shown that all samples, although exhibiting sharp melting points varying from 56 to 101 \textdegree{}C, have identical IR and solid-state NMR spectra and identical crystal structures. NMR studies of the melts provided the key to the understanding of this strange behavior: differently melting samples did so because they initially melted to liquids with different proportions of the Z and E isomers, although given enough time they all tended to the same equilibrium proportion. The leading role of the isomerization rate in the melt was confirmed in cyclic differential scanning calorimetry experiments and accompanying simulations. In the case of polymorphism, different structures melt to the same liquid. In the present case, the same structure melts to different liquids.},

Even for the fundamental hard-disk model, the melting mechanism has not been agreed upon after 50 years of studies. A recent Monte Carlo algorithm allows us to thermalize systems large enough to access the thermodynamic regime. We show that melting in hard disks proceeds in two steps with a liquid phase, a hexatic phase, and a solid. The hexatic-solid transition is continuous while, surprisingly, the liquid-hexatic transition is of first order. This melting scenario solves one of the fundamental statistical-physics models, which is at the root of a large body of theoretical, computational, and experimental research.},

The important role played by computer simulations in studying and understanding the dynamics of systems close to the glass transition at the molecular level is given. The recent progress on the subject of the spatially heterogeneous dynamics that characterizes structural relaxation in materials with slow dynamics is reviewed. The main theoretical approaches are presented describing the glass transition in supercooled liquids, focusing on theories that have a microscopic, statistical mechanics basis. We describe both successes and failures and critically assess the current status of each of these approaches. The physics of aging dynamics in disordered materials and the rheology of soft glassy materials are then discussed, and recent theoretical progress is described. For each section, an extensive overview is given of the most recent advances, but we also describe in some detail the important open problems that will occupy a central place in this field in the coming years.},

Translational diffusion coefficients ranged from 10-6 to 10-15 cm2/s over a similar temperature range. The rotational correlation times of all probes have essentially the same temperature dependence as the viscosity of TNB. In contrast, the translational diffusion of the smallest probe, tetracene, is observed to have a significantly weaker temperature dependence. At Tg, the translational diffusion coefficient of tetracene is 300 times larger than expected based on its rotational correlation time. Similar enhancements of translational diffusion near Tg have recently been observed in other glass-forming liquids. These observations suggest that dynamics in TNB and other supercooled liquids are spatially heterogeneous.

If the dependence of this vectorial force on the atomic chemical environment can be learned efficiently with high fidelity from benchmark reference results\textemdash{}using ``big-data'' techniques, i.e., without resorting to actual functional forms\textemdash{}then this capability can be harnessed to enormously speed up in silico materials simulations. The present contribution provides several examples of how such a force field for Al can be used to go far beyond the length-scale and time-scale regimes presently accessible using quantum-mechanical methods. It is argued that pathways are available to systematically and continuously improve the predictive capability of such a learned force field in an adaptive manner, and that this concept can be generalized to include multiple elements.},

To improve the scientific productivity of users, NERSC provides a large number of pre-compiled applications on the Cray XE6 machine, Hopper. Depending on the compiler, compiler flags and libraries used to build the codes, applications can have large differences in performance. In this paper, we compare the performance differences arising from the use of different compilers, compiler optimization flags and libraries available on Hopper over a set of materials science and chemistry applications that are widely used at NERSC. The selected applications are written in Fortran, C, C++, or a combination of these languages, and use MPI or other massage passing libraries as well as linear algebra, FFT, and global array libraries. The compilers explored are the PGI, GNU, Cray, and Intel compilers. It should be emphasized that the compiler optimizations ultimately adopted for production builds are optimizations where the resulting binaries pass strict validity checks and can be used for scientific calculations. These builds do not necessarily represent the highest optimizations the compilers can reach.},

The standard set of proper evaluation metrics is well-known but the usual assumption is that the test dataset imbalance equals the real-world imbalance. In practice, this assumption is often broken for various reasons. The reported results are then often too optimistic and may lead to wrong conclusions about industrial impact and suitability of proposed techniques. We introduce methods focusing on evaluation under non-constant class imbalance. We show that not only the absolute values of commonly used metrics, but even the order of classifiers in relation to the evaluation metric used is affected by the change of the imbalance rate. Finally, we demonstrate that using subsampling in order to get a test dataset with class imbalance equal to the one observed in the wild is not necessary, and eventually can lead to significant errors in classifier's performance estimate.},

This equivalence serves as an explanation of the puzzling fact that the numerical predictions of both theories for condensation of Xe and CO2 are almost identical though the standard analytical expressions for the nucleation rates are different.

  abstract = {Often, in a regression situation with many variables, a sequence of submodels is generated containing fewer variables by using such methods as stepwise addition or deletion of variables, or 'best subsets'. The question is which of this sequence of submodels is 'best', and how can submodel performance be evaluated. This was explored in Breiman (1988) for a fixed X-design. This is a sequel exploring the case of random X-designs. Analytical results are difficult, if not impossible. This study involved an extensive simulation. The basis of the study is the theoretical definition of prediction error (PE) as the expected squared error produced by applying a prediction equation to the distributional universe of (y, x) values. This definition is used throughout to compare various submodels. There can be startling differences between the x-fixed and x-random situations and different PE estimates are appropriate. Non-resampling estimates such as CP, adjusted R2, etc. turn out to be highly biased methods for submodel selection. The two best methods are cross-validation and bootstrap. One surprise is that 5 fold cross-validation (leave out 20\% of the data) is better at submodel selection and evaluation than leave-one-out cross-validation. There are a number of other surprises. /// Dans l'analyse de probl{\`e}mes de r{\'e}gression {\`a} plusieurs variables (ind{\'e}pendantes), on produit souvent une s{\'e}rie de sous-mod{\`e}les constitu{\'e}s d'un sous-ensemble des variables par des m{\'e}thodes telles que l'addition par {\'e}tape, le retrait par {\'e}tape et la m{\'e}thode du meilleur sous-ensemble.

In practice, generalizability is frequently estimated by averaging the accuracies obtained on individual crossvalidation folds. This procedure, however, is problematic in two ways. First, it does not allow for the derivation of meaningful confidence intervals. Second, it leads to an optimistic estimate when a biased classifier is tested on an imbalanced dataset. We show that both problems can be overcome by replacing the conventional point estimate of accuracy by an estimate of the posterior distribution of the balanced accuracy.},

The pressure as a function of density along the T=1 isotherm has a narrow nonmonotonic region with a symmetric loop, indicative of a weak first-order melting transition. This identification and the location of the transition is in good agreement with that obtained from an analysis of the free energies of the fluid and solid phases. Equilibration problems are found in the solid phase and the melting of a defective solid is also investigated. The behavior of the pair distribution function, angular correlation function, diffusion constant, and the defect structure uncovered by an analysis of nearest-neighbor polygons is generally consistent with a first-order mechanism. Evidence for direct fluid-solid coexistence is presented. However, a very small fluid-solid interface tension is indicated, and there is a rapid growth in the range of correlations in the fluid near freezing. The behavior of the elastic constants at melting is in fairly good agreement with the Halperin-Nelson melting criterion.},

The observed effect highlights a general deficiency of the most frequently used thermodynamic theories for crystal nucleation. Surface stress should lead to an experimentally observable expansion of crystal nuclei of colloids with short-ranged attraction and of globular proteins.},

Central to the stability of the granules is the capillary force arising from the interfacial tension between solvent and air. This force appears capable of maintaining a granule in a jammed solid state, under conditions where the same amount of solvent and colloid could also exist as a flowable droplet. We argue that in the early stages of granulation the physics of dilatancy, which requires that a powder expand on shearing, is converted by capillary forces into the physics of arrest. Using a schematic model of colloidal arrest under stress, we speculate upon various jamming and granulation scenarios. Some preliminary experimental results on aspects of granulation in hard-sphere colloidal suspensions are also presented.},

  abstract = {When we lower the temperature of a liquid, at some point we meet a first order phase transition to the crystal. Yet, under certain conditions it is possible to keep the system in its metastable phase and to avoid crystallization. In this way the liquid enters in the supercooled phase. Supercooled liquids have a very rich phenomenology, which is still far from being completely understood. To begin with, there is the problem of how to prevent crystallization and how deeply the liquid can be supercooled before a metastability limit is hit. But by far the most interesting feature of supercooled liquids is the dynamic glass transition: when the temperature is decreased below a certain point, the relaxation time increases so much that a dramatic dynamical arrest intervenes and we are unable to equilibrate the system within reasonable experimental times. The glass transition is a phenomenon whose physical origin has stirred an enormous interest in the last hundred years. Why does it occur? Is it just a conventional reference point, or does it have a more profound physical meaning? Is it a purely dynamical event, or the manifestation of a true thermodynamic transition? What is the correlation length associated to the sharp increase of the relaxation time? Can we define a new kind of amorphous order? A shared theory of supercooled liquids and the glass transition does not yet exist and these questions are still largely open. Here, I will illustrate in the most elementary fashion the main phenomenological traits of supercooled liquids and discuss in a very partial way a few theoretical ideas on the subject. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This structure emerges from spatial correlations of dynamics that appear in disordered systems as they approach nonergodic or jammed states. It is characterized in terms of dynamical heterogeneity, facilitation, and excitation lines. These features are associated with a newly discovered class of nonequilibrium phase transitions. Equilibrium properties have little, if anything, to do with it. The broken symmetries of these transitions are obscure or absent in spatial structures, but they are vivid in space-time (i.e., trajectory space). In our view, the glass transition is an example of this class of transitions. The basic ideas and principles we review were originally developed through the analysis of idealized and abstract models. Nevertheless, the central ideas are easily illustrated with reference to molecular dynamics of more realistic atomistic models, and we use that illustrative approach here.},

  abstract = {The structure of metallic glasses (MGs) has been a long-standing mystery. On the one hand, MGs are amorphous materials with no long-range structural order; on the other hand, topological and chemical short-to-medium range order is expected to be pronounced in these alloys, due to their high atomic packing density and the varying chemical affinity between the constituent elements. The unique internal structure of MGs underlies their interesting properties, which render MGs potentially useful for various applications. While more and more glass-forming alloys have been developed in recent years, fundamental knowledge on the structural aspect of MGs remains seriously lacking. For example, how atoms pack on the short-to-medium range, how the structure differs in different MGs and changes with composition, temperature, and processing history, and more importantly, how the structure influences the properties of MGs, are still unresolved questions. In this paper, we review the tremendous efforts over the past 50years devoted to unraveling the atomic-level structure of MGs and the structural origin of their unique behaviors. Emphasis will be placed on the progress made in recent years, including advances in structural characterization and analysis of prototypical MGs, general structural models and fundamental principles, and the correlations of thermodynamic, kinetic, and mechanical properties with the MG structures. Some widely observed property\textendash{}property correlations in MGs are also examined from the structural perspective. The insights summarized are shown to shed light on many intriguing behaviors of the MG-forming alloys and expected to impact the development of MGs.

We pay special attention to the wave number dependence of the collective dynamics. It is shown that the simulation results for the model share many features with experimental data for real system, and that MCT captures the simulation results at the semiquantitative level except for intermediate wave numbers connected to the overall size of the molecule. Theoretical results at the intermediate wave number region are found to be improved by taking into account the spatial correlation of the molecule's geometrical center. This supports the idea that unusual dynamical properties at the intermediate wave numbers, reported previously in simulation studies for the model and discernible in coherent neutron-scattering experimental data, are basically due to the coupling of the rotational motion to the geometrical-center dynamics. However, there still remain qualitative as well as quantitative discrepancies between theoretical prediction and corresponding simulation results at the intermediate wave numbers, which call for further theoretical investigation.},

The nature of the plate has been tuned from hydrophobic to hydrophilic and vice versa by varying plate-water dispersion interaction. Analyses of the translational dynamics as performed by calculating mean squared displacements of the confined water reveal a monotonically decreasing trend of the diffusivity with increasing hydrophilicity of the plates. Orientational dynamics of the confined water also follows the same monotonic trend. Although orientational time constant almost does not change with the increase of plate-water dispersion interaction in the hydrophobic regime corresponding to the smaller plate-water attraction, it changes considerably in the hydrophilic regime corresponding to larger plate-water dispersion interactions.},

Wolfgang and his students have given generously of their time and effort, and this generosity is deeply appreciated. Much work remains to be done.

With the strongly increased interest in machine learning in general, it has, as a result, become difficult to keep track of what represents the state-of-the-art at the moment, e.g., for top-n recommendation tasks. At the same time, several recent publications point out problems in today's research practice in applied machine learning, e.g., in terms of the reproducibility of the results or the choice of the baselines when proposing new models. In this work, we report the results of a systematic analysis of algorithmic proposals for top-n recommendation tasks. Specifically, we considered 18 algorithms that were presented at top-level research conferences in the last years. Only 7 of them could be reproduced with reasonable effort. For these methods, it however turned out that 6 of them can often be outperformed with comparably simple heuristic methods, e.g., based on nearest-neighbor or graph-based techniques. The remaining one clearly outperformed the baselines but did not consistently outperform a well-tuned non-neural linear ranking method. Overall, our work sheds light on a number of potential problems in today's machine learning scholarship and calls for improved scientific practices in this area.

  abstract = {The efficacy of drug treatments depends on how tightly small molecules bind to their target proteins. The rapid and accurate quantification of the strength of these interactions (as measured by binding affinity) is a grand challenge of computational chemistry, surmounting which could revolutionize drug design and provide the platform for patient-specific medicine. Recent evidence suggests that molecular dynamics (MD) can achieve useful predictive accuracy ({$<$} 1 kcal/mol). For this predictive accuracy to impact clinical decision making, binding free energy computational campaigns must provide results rapidly and without loss of accuracy. This demands advances in algorithms, scalable software systems, and efficient utilization of supercomputing resources. We introduce a framework called HTBAC, designed to support accurate and scalable drug binding affinity calculations, while marshaling large simulation campaigns. We show that HTBAC supports the specification and execution of free-energy protocols at scale. This paper makes three main contributions: (1) shows the importance of adaptive execution for ensemble-based free energy protocols to improve binding affinity accuracy; (2) presents and characterizes HTBAC -- a software system that enables the scalable and adaptive execution of binding affinity protocols at scale; and (3) for a widely used free-energy protocol (TIES), shows improvements in the accuracy of simulations for a fixed amount of resource, or reduced resource consumption for a fixed accuracy as a consequence of adaptive execution.},

Using multi-stage pipelines of molecular simulations we can gain insights into the binding free energy and the residence time of a ligand, which can inform both stratified and personal treatment regimes and drug development. To support the scalable, adaptive and automated calculation of the binding free energy on high-performance computing resources, we introduce the High-throughput Binding Affinity Calculator (HTBAC).

The most common way of making a glass is by cooling a viscous liquid fast enough to avoid crystallization. Although this route to the vitreous state-supercooling-has been known for millennia, the molecular processes by which liquids acquire amorphous rigidity upon cooling are not fully understood. Here we discuss current theoretical knowledge of the manner in which intermolecular forces give rise to complex behaviour in supercooled liquids and glasses. An intriguing aspect of this behaviour is the apparent connection between dynamics and thermodynamics. The multidimensional potential energy surface as a function of particle coordinates (the energy landscape) offers a convenient viewpoint for the analysis and interpretation of supercooling and glass-formation phenomena. That much of this analysis is at present largely qualitative reflects the fact that precise computations of how viscous liquids sample their landscape have become possible only recently.},

  abstract = {We apply a semi-supervised technique called Supervised Principal Component (SPC) to explore the relationship between the composition of a thin film combinatorial library and the peaks of Time-Of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) spectra acquired from the library. SPC is first used to select a subset of the available multivariate features (the peak intensities of the ToF-SIMS spectra) based on their association with the outcome variable (the elemental concentration of the thin film samples). Next, using only the selected features, SPC creates optimal linear models which map the ToF-SIMS data onto the composition data. The models for the first two of the considered elemental concentrations use only eight of the 55 available ToF-SIMS peaks, making interpretation of the model much simpler than for a model which uses all 55 available peaks. The percentage of explained variance (R2) in concentration data is in both cases about 0.80. These results are obtained during the model validation phase, performed on test data, which are exclusively used for this purpose. The model for the third considered element did not produce significant results due to the poor variability of the dataset. This work illustrates for the first time that using a multivariate analysis technique, one can establish the relationship between ToF-SIMS measurements and stoichiometric data in a combinatorial experiment. More generally, the described feature selection approach provides an example of how combinatorial experiments can be useful for accelerating the understanding of the chemical\textendash{}physical behaviors under investigation.},

The continuum transport equations describing these systems are reviewed, numerical solution strategies are outlined, and the special modeling challenges posed by the crystal growth are discussed. At a microscopic scale of tens of nanometers or less, ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) methods are employed to study the atomic behavior of crystallization. Molecular dynamics methods based on classical potentials are able to compute for much larger ensembles and longer time scales. To simulate even larger length scales and longer time scales, the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method can be applied to many systems. On a macroscopic scale of tens of microns and larger, the continuum methods can be applied to describe the physical phenomena. There are various phenomena associated with the crystal growth that can occur on a ``meso-scale'', comprising hundreds of nanometer to tens of microns and occurring over long time scales. In the case of bulk crystal growth, modeling directly connects the processing conditions to the outcomes. Since bulk crystals are usually incorporated into the electronic, optical, or optoelectronic devices, the outcome is measured in terms of the crystal properties relevant to these devices.},

Here we examine the barriers and cage-breaking rearrangements that are pertinent to long-term diffusion. Single-step cage-breaking processes, which follow high-barrier routes, are identified, and different methods and criteria for defining a cage-breaking process are considered. We examine the extent to which a description of cage-breaking within the energy landscape is a description of long-term diffusion. This description includes the identification of cage-breaks that are reversed, and those that are productive towards long-term diffusion. At low temperatures, diffusion is adequately described by productive cage-breaks, or by considering all cage-breaks and accounting for the effect of reversals. To estimate the diffusion constant we require only the mean square displacement of a cage-break, the average waiting time for a cage-break, and a measure of the number of reversed cage-breaks. Cage-breaks can be visualized within the potential energy landscape using disconnectivity graphs, and we compare the use of productive cage-breaks with previous definitions of ``megabasins'' or ``metabasins.''},

We compare our approach to already used methods and show that the quality of identification increases significantly. The technique works very well for highly disturbed lattices and shows a flexible and robust way to classify crystalline structures that can be used by only providing particle positions.

  abstract = {We study the relation of the potential energy landscape (PEL) topography to relaxation dynamics of a small model glass former of Lennard-Jones type. The mechanism under investigation is the hopping between superstructures of PEL minima, called metabasins (MBs). Guided by the idea that the mean durations {$\langle\tau\rangle$} of visits to MBs should reflect the local PEL structure, we first derive the effective depths of MBs from dynamics, by the relation Eapp=dln\langle{$\tau\rangle$}/d{$\beta$}, where {$\beta$}=1/kBT. Second, we establish a connection of Eapp to the barriers that surround MBs. As the consequence of a rugged PEL, it turns out that escapes from MBs do not happen by single hops between PEL minima, but correspond to complicated multiminima sequences. We introduce the concept of return probabilities to the bottom of the MBs in order to judge when the attraction range of a MB has been left. The energy barriers overcome can then be identified. These turn out to be in good agreement with the effective depths Eapp, calculated from dynamics. We are thus able to relate MB lifetimes to their local structure. Moreover, we can trace back the overall diffusive dynamics to the population of MBs and to their local topology, i.e., to purely thermodynamic and structural quantities. Single energy barriers are identified with the help of a new method, which accurately performs a descent along the ridge between two minima. We analyze the population of transition regions between minima, called basin borders. No indication for the mechanism of diffusion to change around the mode-coupling temperature can be found. We discuss the question whether the one-dimensional reaction paths connecting two minima are relevant for the calculation of reaction rates at the temperatures under study.},

The immobile particles form the cores of relatively compact clusters, while the mobile particles move cooperatively and form quasi-one-dimensional, stringlike clusters. The strength and length scale of the correlations between mobile particles are found to grow strongly with decreasing temperature, and the mean cluster size appears to diverge near the mode-coupling critical temperature. We show that these correlations in the particle displacements are related to equilibrium fluctuations in the local potential energy and local composition.},

We present NN-Descent, a simple yet efficient algorithm for approximate K-NNG construction with arbitrary similarity measures. Our method is based on local search, has minimal space overhead and does not rely on any shared global index. Hence, it is especially suitable for large-scale applications where data structures need to be distributed over the network. We have shown with a variety of datasets and similarity measures that the proposed method typically converges to above 90\% recall with each point comparing only to several percent of the whole dataset on average.},

As a liquid is cooled far below its melting point, dynamics in some regions of the sample can be orders of magnitude faster than dy- namics in other regions only a few nanometers away. In this review, the experimental work that characterizes this heterogeneity is described. In particular, the following questions are addressed: How large are the heterogeneities? How long do they last? How much do dynamics vary between the fastest and slowest regions? Why do these heterogeneities arise? The answers to these questions influence practical applications of glass-forming materials, including polymers, metallic glasses, and pharmaceuti- cals.},

Driven out of equilibrium, their dynamics results in the evolution of those interfaces, during which those might develop into well-defined structures with characteristic length scales at the nano-, micro- or mesoscale.

Phase-field modelling is an approach that allows us to tackle this challenge simulation-based. This overview summarizes briefly the essentials of the conceptual background of the phase-field method, as well as recent issues the phase-field community is focusing on, as far as they are related to nucleation. To that end a brief introduction to the basic understanding underlying the diffuse interface description, which is the conceptual backbone of phase-field modelling, is given at the beginning, followed by a detailed picture of its achievements so far in applications to nucleation phenomena in metals and colloids. Within the most relevant fields of condensed matter physics, approached by phase-field modelling until now, applications to metallic systems are a traditional domain of phase-field modelling and nucleation phenomena therein have been addressed by several groups. This paper provides an overview of these. Advances in the field of colloidal systems, on the other hand, are only more recent and are addressed here in the context of contributions to soft matter physics in general.},

The PFC method operates on atomic length and diffusive time scales, and thus constitutes a computationally efficient alternative to molecular simulation methods. Its intense development in materials science started fairly recently following the work by Elder et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 88 (2002), p. 245701]. Since these initial studies, dynamical density functional theory and thermodynamic concepts have been linked to the PFC approach to serve as further theoretical fundamentals for the latter. In this review, we summarize these methodological development steps as well as the most important applications of the PFC method with a special focus on the interaction of development steps taken in hard and soft matter physics, respectively. Doing so, we hope to present today's state of the art in PFC modelling as well as the potential, which might still arise from this method in physics and materials science in the nearby future.},

However, unlike axially symmetric quasicrystals, IQCs have not been observed in non-atomic (that is, micellar or nanoparticle) systems, where real-space information would be directly available. Here, we show that an IQC can be assembled by means of molecular dynamics simulations from a one-component system of particles interacting via a tunable, isotropic pair potential extending only to the third-neighbour shell. The IQC is body-centred, self-assembles from a fluid phase, and in parameter space neighbours clathrates and other tetrahedrally bonded crystals. Our findings elucidate the structure and dynamics of the IQC, and suggest routes to search for it and design it in soft matter and nanoscale systems.},

In the present work, we model the process of nucleation and growth using a combination of classical nucleation and phase-field theory. A diffusion coupled phase-field model is used to evaluate the work of formation and the growth behavior of the critical nucleus. The results are combined with classical nucleation and JMAK theory in order to estimate the glass forming ability of the compositions Cu64Zr36,Cu10Zr7 and CuZr2 in terms of TTT-diagrams and critical cooling rates. It is found that the work of formation of the critical nucleus from the phase-field theory agrees with the classical theory when the critical size is larger than the width of the solid-liquid interface. At smaller critical sizes, the work of formation deviates approximately linearly between the two theories. Furthermore, it is shown that the growth behavior from the phase-field simulations agree with analytical expressions of the growth rate from the classical theory.},

It is shown that the intuitively defined Lattman metric [1] is a scalar multiple of the metric tensor which arises naturally from the Jacobi formulation of the action principle for spherical tops. It is then shown that Euler's quaternion parameters lead to a euclidean form for the orientation metric. These parameters lead to many associated simplifications in the equations of motion of classical rigid bodies including the removal of singularities and spurious behaviour near \texttheta{} = 0. It is felt that these benefits will translate into increased accuracy and efficiency both for numerical integration of the equations of motion and for performing Monte Carlo integrations of phase space.},

  abstract = {Using molecular dynamic simulations of an extended-simple-point-charge model of water, we investigated the effect of translation-rotation coupling on the motion of the hydrogen atom in a water molecule in low temperature water. We introduce a translation-rotation probability distribution P-CM,P-Omega(r,theta(R),t), where r(t) is the scalar displacement of the center of mass from origin at time t starting from the origin at t=0; and theta(R)(t)=arccos[b(t).b(0)/b(2)] is the angle of rotation of the vector, b, connecting the center of mass of the water molecule to the hydrogen atom position. We developed a procedure to determine P-CM,P-Omega(r,theta(R),t) starting from the van Hove self-correlation function of the center of mass, G(s)(CM)(r,t), taking into account the translation-rotation coupling effect. In the long time region, we use a translation-rotation coupling parameter, Q(*), to determine the angular dependence of P-CM,P-Omega(r,theta(R),t) from G(s)(CM)(r,t). Thus, the dynamics of the hydrogen atoms in a water molecule is fully determined by the van Hove self-correlation function of the center of mass and by the value of the translation-rotation coupling parameter. In particular, we show that the self intermediate scattering function of the hydrogen atom can be calculated with a better accuracy than using the traditional decoupling approximation. The model can be used to analyze incoherent quasielastic neutron scattering spectra of water in the future. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

Sivak et al., introduced a convenient approach to approximating a natural measure of error between the sampled density and the target equilibrium density, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, in phase space, but did not specifically address the issue of configuration-space properties, which are much more commonly of interest in molecular simulations. Here, we introduce a variant of this near-equilibrium estimator capable of measuring the error in the configuration-space marginal density, validating it against a complex but exact nested Monte Carlo estimator to show that it reproduces the KL divergence with high fidelity. To illustrate its utility, we employ this new near-equilibrium estimator to assess a claim that a recently proposed Langevin integrator introduces extremely small configuration-space density errors up to the stability limit at no extra computational expense. Finally, we show how this approach to quantifying sampling bias can be applied to a wide variety of stochastic integrators by following a straightforward procedure to compute the appropriate shadow work, and describe how it can be extended to quantify the error in arbitrary marginal or conditional distributions of interest.},

I suppose that most of us, talking about supercooling a couple of years ago, would have divided substances into two classes, one with simple crystal structures like gold, and all the other `good' metals on the one hand, and those with complex crystal structures, such as glycerol and the silicates on the other; saying that whereas the latter class can be very much supercooled, and will form glasses, the former class can only be supercooled a very few degrees. Then we would have added that there are some ` bad ' metals, with moderately complex crystal structures, such as antimony or bismuth, which can be supercooled some tens of degrees, forming an intermediate class. I think we would then have added that this is quite comprehensible. In particular, that the X-ray diffraction patterns of the monatomic liquids show us that most of the atoms have the right numbers of nearest neighbours in a first co-ordination shell, all ready in place to start the growth of a crystal; which readily explains why these substances cannot be supercooled very much\textemdash{}a nice simple experimental fact, with a straightforward theoretical interpretation\textemdash{}and both are wrong.},

Motivated by the desire to simplify the process and improve the accuracy, we introduce DeepIce, a novel deep neural network designed to identify ice and water molecules, which can be generalized to new structures where multiple bonding environments are present. DeepIce demonstrates that the characteristics of a crystalline or liquid molecule can be classified using as input simply the Cartesian coordinates of the nearest neighbors without compromising the accuracy. The network is flexible and capable of inferring rotational invariance and produces a high predictive accuracy compared to the Steinhardt approach, the tetrahedral order parameter and polyhedral template matching in the detection of the phase of molecules in premelted ice surfaces.},

In this case, a theoretical analysis of dendritic solidification is given for congruently melting alloys in which chemical segregation does not occur.

Recent simulations of coupled replicas in atomistic models have found signatures of a static transition as a function of replica coupling. This can be viewed as evidence of an associated thermodynamic glass transition in the uncoupled system. We demonstrate here that a different interpretation is possible. We consider the triangular plaquette model, an interacting spin system which displays (East model-like) glassy dynamics in the absence of any static transition. We show that when two replicas are coupled there is a curve of equilibrium phase transitions, between phases of small and large overlap, in the temperature-coupling plane (located on the self-dual line of an exact temperature/coupling duality of the system) which ends at a critical point. Crucially, in the limit of vanishing coupling the finite temperature transition disappears, and the uncoupled system is in the disordered phase at all temperatures. We discuss interpretation of atomistic simulations in light of this result.},

  abstract = {Despite progress in the understanding of crystal nucleation and crystal growth since the first theories for nucleation were developed, an exact quantitative prediction of the nucleation rates in most systems has remained an unsolved problem. Colloidal suspensions show a phase behavior that is analogous to atomic or molecular systems and serve accordingly as ideal model systems for studying crystal nucleation with an accuracy and depth on a microscopic scale that is hard to reach for atomic or molecular systems. Due to the mesoscopic size of colloidal particles they can be studied in detail on the single-particle level and their dynamics is strongly slowed down in comparison with atomic or molecular systems, such that the formation of a crystal nucleus can be followed in detail. In this review, recent progress in the study of homogeneous and heterogeneous crystal nucleation in colloids and the controlled growth of crystalline colloidal structures is reviewed. All this work has resulted in unprecedented insights into the early stage of nucleation and it is also relevant for a deeper understanding of soft matter materials in general as well as for possible applications based on colloidal suspensions.},

The software supports short-ranged pair force and bond force fields and achieves optimal GPU performance using an autotuning algorithm. We are able to demonstrate equivalent or superior scaling on up to 3375 GPUs in Lennard-Jones and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations of up to 108 million particles. GPUDirect RDMA capabilities in recent GPU generations provide better performance in full double precision calculations.

The natural fit between machine learning and pharmaceutical research leads to the common utilization of learning algorithms to construct quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR). Until recently, the application of machine learning methods is primarily the domain of specialists in the artificial intelligence or statistics fields. Early machine learning software requires an intimate knowledge of the algorithms and a familiarity with specialized programming languages, such as Prolog or Lisp. The availability of easily accessible, high-quality software has led to the widespread adoption of machine learning among computational chemists. Although modern machine learning techniques require minimal parameter adjustment to achieve reasonable results, it is inappropriate to treat these techniques as black boxes. As with other QSAR techniques, model quality and applicability must be judiciously assessed.},

Here we describe the formation of these 'dizzy dendrites' using a phase-field theory, in which randomly distributed foreign particle inclusions perturb the crystallization by deflecting the tips of the growing dendrite arms. This mechanism of crystallization, which is verified experimentally, leads to a polycrystalline structure dependent on particle configuration and orientation.

Phase-field simulations show that the presence of particulates (for example, dirt) or a small rotational\textendash{}translational mobility ratio (characteristic of high supercooling) in crystallizing fluids give rise to similar growth patterns, implying a duality in the growth process in these structurally heterogeneous fluids. Similar crystallization patterns are also found in thin polymer films with particulate additives and pure films with high supercooling.

  abstract = {Many structural materials (metal alloys, polymers, minerals, etc.) are formed by quenching liquids into crystalline solids. This highly nonequilibrium process often leads to polycrystalline growth patterns that are broadly termed ``spherulites'' because of their large-scale average spherical shape. Despite the prevalence and practical importance of spherulite formation, only rather qualitative concepts of this phenomenon exist. It is established that phase field methods naturally account for diffusional instabilities that are responsible for dendritic single-crystal growth. However, a generalization of this model is required to describe spherulitic growth patterns, and in the present paper we propose a minimal model of this fundamental crystal growth process. Our calculations indicate that the diversity of spherulitic growth morphologies arises from a competition between the ordering effect of discrete local crystallographic symmetries and the randomization of the local crystallographic orientation that accompanies crystal grain nucleation at the growth front [growth front nucleation (GFN)]. This randomization in the orientation accounts for the isotropy of spherulitic growth at large length scales and long times. In practice, many mechanisms can give rise to GFN, and the present work describes and explores three physically prevalent sources of disorder that lead to this kind of growth. While previous phase field modeling elucidated two of these mechanisms\textemdash{}disorder created by particulate impurities or other static disorder or by the dynamic heterogeneities that spontaneously form in supercooled liquids (even pure ones)\textemdash{}the present paper considers an additional mechanism, crystalline branching induced by a misorientation-dependent grain boundary energy, which can significantly affect spherulite morphology. We find the entire range of observed spherulite morphologies can be reproduced by this generalized phase field model of polycrystalline growth.},

We recall results obtained both by the conventional phase-field approaches that rely on spatially averaged (coarse grained) order parameters in capturing freezing, and by the recently developed phase-field crystal models that work on the molecular scale, while employing time averaged particle densities, and are regarded as simple dynamical density functional theories of classical particles. Besides simpler cases of homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation, phenomena addressed by these techniques include precursor assisted nucleation, nucleation in eutectic and phase separating systems, phase selection via competing nucleation processes, growth front nucleation (a process, in which grains of new orientations form at the solidification front) yielding crystal sheaves and spherulites, and transition between the growth controlled cellular and the nucleation dominated equiaxial solidification morphologies.},

Marginally jammed states of trimers with lower \$\textbackslash{}phi\_J(\textbackslash{}theta\_0)\$ exhibit quantifiably greater disorder, and the lower \$\textbackslash{}phi\_J\$ for small \$\textbackslash{}theta\_0\$ is apparently caused by trimers' decreasing effective configurational freedom as they approach linearity.},

The Jupyter notebook (formerly known as the IPython notebook) is an ideal platform for creating assignments that include all of these question types, due to its interactive document format that weaves together code, prose, images, and math. Instructors can provide students with self-contained notebooks that include instructions, coding exercises, and written responses all in the same place. Students can write and execute code in these notebooks, and any text or images produced by the code are displayed immediately beneath the input that produced them. However, while having all exercises in the same place makes for better assignments, it also makes them difficult to grade. This demo presents nbgrader, an open-source tool developed by the Jupyter project that solves this problem by providing an interface that blends the autograding of notebook-based assignments with manual human grading. Additionally, nbgrader streamlines the process of assignment creation, distribution, collection, grading, and feedback-a process that is often logistically difficult for instructors. To give students access to the notebook, this demo illustrates how it can be deployed in the cloud, and how this complements the grading process. Information about the Jupyter notebook can be found at http://jupyter.org/, and a demo of the notebook at https://try.jupyter.org/. Information about nbgrader can be found at https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader. A laptop is recommended for this demo. Handouts will be provided.},

The repulsive part is treated "exactly" by Monte Carlo computations with a 864-atom system, and the attractive part is treated as a perturbation. The "unperturbed" potential, which is homogeneous in the coordinates of the interacting particles, has trivial scaling properties which greatly simplify the computations. The attractive perturbation is treated to first order; the second-order corrections are shown to be very small at not-too-low temperatures. A high-temperature equation of state is obtained for the Lennard-Jones fluid, which is in excellent agreement with exact Monte Carlo computations at temperatures as low as about twice the critical temperature. Using the Hoover-Ree scheme, the free energy of the solid is determined and the transition densities and pressures calculated in the first-order approximation, which is shown to be quite satisfactory. The validity of Lindemann's melting "law" and a crystallization criterion based on the maximum of the structure factor are investigated.},

These methods range from a simple sum over atoms, to addition of bond energies, to pairwise interatomic force fields, reaching to the more sophisticated machine learning approaches that are capable of describing collective interactions between many atoms or bonds. In the case of equilibrium molecular geometries, even simple pairwise force fields demonstrate prediction accuracy comparable to benchmark energies calculated using density functional theory with hybrid exchange-correlation functionals; however, accounting for the collective many-body interactions proves to be essential for approaching the ``holy grail'' of chemical accuracy of 1 kcal/mol for both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium geometries. This remarkable accuracy is achieved by a vectorized representation of molecules (so-called Bag of Bonds model) that exhibits strong nonlocality in chemical space. In addition, the same representation allows us to predict accurate electronic properties of molecules, such as their polarizability and molecular frontier orbital energies.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of the temperature-dependent crystal growth rates of the salts, NaCl and ZnS, from their melts are reported, along with those of a number of pure metals. The growth rate of NaCl and the fcc-forming metals show little evidence of activated control, while that of ZnS and Fe, a bcc forming metal, exhibit activation barriers similar to those observed for diffusion in the melt. Unlike ZnS and Fe, the interfacial inherent structures of NaCl and Cu and Ag are found to be crystalline. We calculate the median displacement between the interfacial liquid and crystalline states and show that this distance is smaller than the ``cage'' length, demonstrating that crystal growth in the fast crystallizers can occur via local vibrations and by doing so largely avoid the activated kinetics associated with the larger displacements associated with particle transport.},

  abstract = {With the continuous expansion of data availability in many large-scale, complex, and networked systems, such as surveillance, security, Internet, and finance, it becomes critical to advance the fundamental understanding of knowledge discovery and analysis from raw data to support decision-making processes. Although existing knowledge discovery and data engineering techniques have shown great success in many real-world applications, the problem of learning from imbalanced data (the imbalanced learning problem) is a relatively new challenge that has attracted growing attention from both academia and industry. The imbalanced learning problem is concerned with the performance of learning algorithms in the presence of underrepresented data and severe class distribution skews. Due to the inherent complex characteristics of imbalanced data sets, learning from such data requires new understandings, principles, algorithms, and tools to transform vast amounts of raw data efficiently into information and knowledge representation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the development of research in learning from imbalanced data. Our focus is to provide a critical review of the nature of the problem, the state-of-the-art technologies, and the current assessment metrics used to evaluate learning performance under the imbalanced learning scenario. Furthermore, in order to stimulate future research in this field, we also highlight the major opportunities and challenges, as well as potential important research directions for learning from imbalanced data.},

  abstract = {.From equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a bead-spring model for short-chain glass-forming polymer melts we calculate several quantities characterizing the single-monomer dynamics near the (extrapolated) critical temperature {$\mathsl{T}$}cTcT\_\{\textbackslash{}rm c\} of mode-coupling theory: the mean-square displacement g0(t), the non-Gaussian parameter {$\mathsl{A}$}2({$\mathsl{t}$}){$\alpha$}2(t) \textbackslash{}alpha\_\{2\}(t) and the self-part of the van Hove function {$\mathsl{G}$}s({$\mathsl{r}$},{$\mathsl{t}$})Gs(r,t) G\_\{\textbackslash{}rm s\}(r,t) which measures the distribution of monomer displacements r in time t. We also determine these quantities from a continuous-time random walk (CTRW) approach. The CTRW is defined in terms of various probability distributions which we know from previous analysis. Utilizing these distributions the CTRW can be solved numerically and compared to the MD data with no adjustable parameter. The MD results reveal the heterogeneous and non-Gaussian single-particle dynamics of the supercooled melt near {$\mathsl{T}$}cTc T\_\{\textbackslash{}rm c\}. In the time window of the early {$\mathsl{A}\alpha\backslash$}alpha relaxation {$\mathsl{A}$}2({$\mathsl{t}$}){$\alpha$}2(t) \textbackslash{}alpha\_\{2\}(t) is large and {$\mathsl{G}$}s({$\mathsl{r}$},{$\mathsl{t}$})Gs(r,t) G\_\{\textbackslash{}rm s\}(r,t) is broad, reflecting the coexistence of monomer displacements that are much smaller (``slow particles'') and much larger (``fast particles'') than the average at time t, i.e. than {$\mathsl{r}$}={$\mathsl{g}$}0({$\mathsl{t}$})1/2r=g0(t)1/2 r = g\_\{0\}(t)\^\{1/2\}. For large r the tail of {$\mathsl{G}$}s({$\mathsl{r}$},{$\mathsl{t}$})Gs(r,t) G\_\{\textbackslash{}rm s\}(r,t) is compatible with an exponential decay, as found for many glassy systems. The CTRW can reproduce the spatiotemporal dependence of {$\mathsl{G}$}s({$\mathsl{r}$},{$\mathsl{t}$})Gs(r,t) G\_\{\textbackslash{}rm s\}(r,t) at a qualitative to semiquantitative level. However, it is not quantitatively accurate in the studied temperature regime, although the agreement with the MD data improves upon cooling. In the early {$\mathsl{A}\alpha\backslash$}alpha regime we also analyze the MD results for {$\mathsl{G}$}s({$\mathsl{r}$},{$\mathsl{t}$})Gs(r,t) G\_\{\textbackslash{}rm s\}(r,t) via the space-time factorization theorem predicted by ideal mode-coupling theory. While we find the factorization to be well satisfied for small r, both above and below {$\mathsl{T}$}cTc T\_\{\textbackslash{}rm c\} , deviations occur for larger r comprising the tail of {$\mathsl{G}$}s({$\mathsl{r}$},{$\mathsl{t}$})Gs(r,t) G\_\{\textbackslash{}rm s\}(r,t). The CTRW analysis suggests that single-particle ``hops'' are a contributing factor for these deviations.Graphical abstract Open image in new window},

The code encompasses a minimal-communication domain decomposition algorithm, full dynamic load balancing, a state-of-the-art parallel constraint solver, and efficient virtual site algorithms that allow removal of hydrogen atom degrees of freedom to enable integration time steps up to 5 fs for atomistic simulations also in parallel. To improve the scaling properties of the common particle mesh Ewald electrostatics algorithms, we have in addition used a Multiple-Program, Multiple-Data approach, with separate node domains responsible for direct and reciprocal space interactions. Not only does this combination of algorithms enable extremely long simulations of large systems but also it provides that simulation performance on quite modest numbers of standard cluster nodes.},

The liquid state diffusion coefficient has been determined for temperatures in the vicinity of the melting points and good agreement with experimental data available for Ag is found. The kinetic coefficients for Au and Ag have been determined by monitoring the velocity of the solid-liquid interface as a function of undercooling. Rates of crystallization for the 100 and 110 directions agree well with a model proposed by Broughton, Gilmer and Jackson [Phys. Rev.

  abstract = {Algorithms to search for crystal structures that optimize some extensive property (energy, volume, etc) typically make use of random particle reorganizations in the context of one or more numerical techniques such as simulated annealing, genetic algorithms or biased random walks, applied to the coordinates of every particle in the unit cell, together with the cell angles and lengths. In this paper we describe the restriction of such searches to predefined isopointal sets, breaking the problem into countable sub-problems which exploit crystal symmetries to reduce the dimensionality of the search space. Applying this method to the search for maximally packed mixtures of hard spheres of two sizes, we demonstrate that the densest packed structures can be identified by searches within a couple of isopointal sets. For the A2B system, the densest known packings over the entire tested range 0.2 {$<$} rA/rB {$<$} 2.5, including some improvements on previous optima, can all be identified by searches within a single isopointal set. In the case of the AB composition, searches of two isopointal sets generate the densest packed structures over the radius ratio range 0.2 {$<$} rA/rB {$<$} 5.0.},

Large systems are used, up to 8000 molecules in the case of the unperturbed 2D films.

One often finds significant deviation from this prediction, in either direction. In supercooled molecular liquids where the ratio {$\tau$}1{$\slash\tau$}2 falls considerably below 3 (the Debye limit), one usually invokes a jump diffusion model to explain the approach of the ratio {$\tau$}1{$\slash\tau$}2 to unity. Here we show in a computer simulation study of a standard model system for thermotropic liquid crystals that this ratio becomes much less than unity as the isotropic-nematic phase boundary is approached from the isotropic side. Simultaneously, the ratio {$\tau$}2{$\slash\eta$}, {$\eta$} being the shear viscosity of the liquid, becomes much larger than the hydrodynamic value near the I-N transition. We also analyze the breakdown of the Debye model of rotational diffusion in ratios of higher order orientational correlation times. We show that the breakdown of the DSE model is due to the growth of orientational pair correlation and provide a mode coupling theory analysis to explain the results.},

In agreement with mode-coupling theory (MCT), we find that the relaxation times of the orientational time correlation functions C(s)1(t), C(s)2(t), and C1(t) show at low temperatures a power law with the same critical temperature Tc, which is also identical to the critical temperature for the translational degrees of freedom. In contrast to MCT, we find, however, that for these correlators the time-temperature superposition principle does not hold well and also the critical exponent {$\gamma$} depends on the correlator. For C(s)l with l=3,\ldots,6 this principle does hold. We also study the temperature dependence of the rotational diffusion constant Dr and demonstrate that at high temperatures Dr is proportional to the translational diffusion constant D and when the system starts to become supercooled the former shows an Arrhenius behavior, whereas the latter exhibits a power-law dependence. We discuss the origin for the difference in the temperature dependence of D (or the relaxation times of C(s)l) and Dr. Finally, we present results that show that at low temperatures 180\textdegree{} flips of the molecule are an important component of the relaxation dynamics for the orientational degrees of freedom.},

These proposals are critically examined with emphasis on the dynamic length scale associated with spatial heterogeneity of local dynamics and the static point-to-set or mosaic length scale of the random firstorder transition theory of equilibrium glass transition. Available results for these length scales, obtained mostly from simulations, are summarized, and the relation of the growth of timescales near the glass transition with the growth of these length scales is examined.

Electron backscatter diffraction is one standard technique for determining crystal structure, typically of materials or geological samples. However, this method requires structural guesses and user input that are often time consuming or incorrect. Kaufmann et al. developed a general methodology using a convolutional neural network that automatically determines the crystal structure quickly and with high accuracy. After the network is exposed to a training set, it can identify the crystal structure without any additional input most of the time, providing a method for eliminating some of the guesswork from crystal structure determination.
Science, this issue p. 564
Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) is one of the primary tools for crystal structure determination. However, this method requires human input to select potential phases for Hough-based or dictionary pattern matching and is not well suited for phase identification. Automated phase identification is the first step in making EBSD into a high-throughput technique. We used a machine learning\textendash{}based approach and developed a general methodology for rapid and autonomous identification of the crystal symmetry from EBSD patterns. We evaluated our algorithm with diffraction patterns from materials outside the training set.

Density-functional theories (DFT) indicate that the cluster/parent phase interface is broad, that the properties of small clusters are not the same as those of macroscopic pieces of the new phase, and that unless the phase transformation occurs near equilibrium, the classical-theory calculation of the work of cluster formation is incorrect. Close to equilibrium, a critical fluctuation of the new phase resembles the critical nucleus in classical nucleation theory (CNT) in various ways: (1) the order parameter (such as the density) at the center of the nucleus approaches the equilibrium value for the new phase, (2) the specific energy associated with the interface approaches that of a flat interface, (3) the size of the fluctuation (corresponding to the cluster radius) is very large, (4) the thickness of the interface is small compared with the size of the fluctuation, and (5) the work of formation for the fluctuation is in reasonable agreement with predictions from CNT.},

By determining the temperature dependence of the interface velocity, an accurate estimate of the melting temperature is provided. The value k=0.0025 m/s/K for the kinetic growth coefficient is found. This value is about two orders of magnitude smaller than that found in recent simulation studies of one-component metals. The classical Wilson-Frenkel model is not able to describe the crystal growth kinetics on a quantitative level.

  abstract = {Structural quantities such as order parameters and correlation functions are often employed to gain insight into the physical behavior and properties of condensed matter systems. Although standard quantities for characterizing structure exist, often they are insufficient for treating problems in the emerging field of nano- and microscale self-assembly, wherein the structures encountered may be complex and unusual. The computer science field of shape matching offers a robust solution to this problem by defining diverse methods for quantifying the similarity between arbitrarily complex shapes. Most order parameters and correlation functions used in condensed matter apply a specific measure of structural similarity within the context of a broader scheme. By substituting shape matching quantities for traditional quantities, we retain the essence of the broader scheme, but extend its applicability to more complex structures. Here we review some standard shape-matching techniques and discuss how they might be used to create highly flexible structural metrics for diverse systems such as self-assembled matter. We provide three proof-of-concept example problems applying shape-matching methods to identifying local and global structures and tracking structural transitions in complex assembled systems. The shape-matching methods reviewed here are applicable to a wide range of condensed matter systems, both simulated and experimental, provided particle positions are known or can be accurately imaged.},

We first introduce the algorithms and computational methods used in MD and describe the general issues in accelerating MD. In the core of this chapter, we show how to design an efficient force computation pipeline for the range-limited force computation, the most time-consuming part of MD and the most mature topic in FPGA acceleration of MD. We discuss computational techniques and simulation quality and present efficient filtering and mapping schemes. We also discuss overall design, host\textendash{}accelerator interaction and other board-level issues. We conclude with future challenges and the potential of production FPGA-accelerated MD.},

In this article we test this suggestion using a single-component Yukawa fluid as a reference system. The available simulation data on self-diffusion in Yukawa fluids, complemented with new data for Yukawa melts (Yukawa fluids near the freezing phase transition), are carefully analyzed. It is shown that although not exact, this earlier suggestion nevertheless provides a very sensible way of normalization of the self-diffusion constant. Additionally, we demonstrate that certain quantitative properties of self-diffusion in Yukawa melts are also shared by systems like one-component plasma and liquid metals at freezing, providing support to an emerging dynamical freezing indicator for simple soft matter systems. The obtained results are also briefly discussed in the context of the theory of momentum transfer in complex (dusty) plasmas.},

  abstract = {In the present study, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to provide an insight into the system size effect on the self-diffusion coefficient of liquids in the periodic rectangular parallelepiped system, from the hydrodynamic perspective. We have previously shown that in the rectangular box system, the diffusivity exhibits anomalous behaviors, i.e., the diffusion tensor appears to be anisotropic despite the bulk liquid simulation and the diffusion component in the direction along the short side of rectangular box with a high aspect ratio exceeding the diffusivity in the infinite system [Kikugawa et al., J.Chem. Phys. 142, 024503 (2015)]. So far, the size effect on the diffusivity has been intensively studied in the cubic system and has been interpreted quite well by the theoretical considerations employing the hydrodynamic interaction. Here, we have extended the hydrodynamic theory to be applied to periodic rectangular box systems and compared the theoretical predictions with MD simulation results. As a result, the diffusivity predicted by the hydrodynamic theory shows good agreement with the MD results. In addition, the system size effect was examined in a rod-shaped rectangular box in which the two shorter side lengths were equivalent and a film-type rectangular box in which the two longer side lengths were equivalent. It is of interest that we found that the aspect ratio, at which the diffusivity coincides with that in the infinite system, is a universal constant independent of the cross-sectional area for the rod system or the thickness for the film system. By extracting the universal structure in the hydrodynamic description, we also suggested a simplified approximate model to accurately predict the size effect on the diffusivity over a practical range of aspect ratios.},

In this Letter, we show by performing molecular dynamics simulations for two-dimensional (2D) colloids that the tracer shape and the local media structure are critical such that rotational diffusion is either suppressed or enhanced depending on the tracer shape. For square tracers dissimilar in structure to the local media structure of 2D colloids, the translation-rotation decoupling occurs and the rotational diffusion is enhanced relative to the translation. For sufficiently large diamond tracers similar in structure to the local media structure, tracers undergo rotational hopping motions and their rotation is suppressed relative to the translation. For distorted-diamond tracers, the decoupling is marginal. Translational diffusion does not change significantly with the tracer shape and obeys the Stokes-Einstein relation.},

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called ``dropout'' that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.},

B 75, 064107 (2007)] to study the effect of the curved, diffuse solid-liquid interface on the interfacial energy as well as the nucleation barrier. The calculation of the interfacial energy and the nucleation barrier certainly depends on the proper definition of the solid-liquid dividing surface and the corresponding nucleus size. We define the position of the sharp interface at which the interfacial energy is to be evaluated by using the concept of equimolar dividing surface (re) and the minimization of the interfacial energy (rs). The comparison of the results based on both radii shows that the difference re-rs is always positive and has a limit for large cluster sizes which is comparable to the Tolman length. Furthermore, we found the real nucleation barrier for small cluster sizes, which is defined as a function of the radius rs, and compared it with the classical nucleation theory. The simulation results also show that the extracted interfacial energy as function of both radii is independent of system size, and this dependence can be reasonably described by the nonclassical Tolman formula with a positive Tolman length.},

It seems to me that we have too often been led astray by sophisticated mathematical models that beautifully capture some of the most intriguing features of glassy behavior, but are too unrealistic to provide bases for predictive theories. As illustrations of what I mean, the first part of this article is devoted to brief summaries of imaginative, sensible, but disparate and often contradictory ideas for solving glass problems. Almost all of these ideas remain alive today, with their own enthusiastic advocates. I then describe numerical simulations, mostly by H Tanaka and coworkers, in which it appears that very simple, polydisperse systems of hard disks and spheres develop long range, Ising-like, bond-orientational order as they approach glass transitions. Finally, I summarize my recent proposal that topologically ordered clusters of particles, in disordered environments, tend to become aligned with each other as if they were two-state systems, and thus produce the observed Ising-like behavior. Neither Tanaka's results nor my proposed interpretation of them fit comfortably within any of the currently popular glass theories.},

  abstract = {We introduce TestU01, a software library implemented in the ANSI C language, and offering a collection of utilities for the empirical statistical testing of uniform random number generators (RNGs). It provides general implementations of the classical statistical tests for RNGs, as well as several others tests proposed in the literature, and some original ones. Predefined tests suites for sequences of uniform random numbers over the interval (0, 1) and for bit sequences are available. Tools are also offered to perform systematic studies of the interaction between a specific test and the structure of the point sets produced by a given family of RNGs. That is, for a given kind of test and a given class of RNGs, to determine how large should be the sample size of the test, as a function of the generator's period length, before the generator starts to fail the test systematically. Finally, the library provides various types of generators implemented in generic form, as well as many specific generators proposed in the literature or found in widely used software. The tests can be applied to instances of the generators predefined in the library, or to user-defined generators, or to streams of random numbers produced by any kind of device or stored in files. Besides introducing TestU01, the article provides a survey and a classification of statistical tests for RNGs. It also applies batteries of tests to a long list of widely used RNGs.},

  abstract = {Biological evolution provides a creative fount of complex and subtle adaptations, often surprising the scientists who discover them. However, because evolution is an algorithmic process that transcends the substrate in which it occurs, evolution's creativity is not limited to nature. Indeed, many researchers in the field of digital evolution have observed their evolving algorithms and organisms subverting their intentions, exposing unrecognized bugs in their code, producing unexpected adaptations, or exhibiting outcomes uncannily convergent with ones in nature. Such stories routinely reveal creativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely fit into the standard scientific narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles to be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their own right. The stories themselves are traded among researchers through oral tradition, but that mode of information transmission is inefficient and prone to error and outright loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared only among practitioners means that many natural scientists do not realize how interesting and lifelike digital organisms are and how natural their evolution can be. To our knowledge, no collection of such anecdotes has been published before. This paper is the crowd-sourced product of researchers in the fields of artificial life and evolutionary computation who have provided first-hand accounts of such cases. It thus serves as a written, fact-checked collection of scientifically important and even entertaining stories. In doing so we also present here substantial evidence that the existence and importance of evolutionary surprises extends beyond the natural world, and may indeed be a universal property of all complex evolving systems.},

At temperatures below Tk, the crystal would have a greater entropy than its liquid. Such a catastrophe is avoided through a glass transition of the liquid above Tk. Fecht and Johnson2 have shown that such a transition should occur for aluminium at 0.23 Tm. A similar entropy catastrophe can also arise at a temperature, TiS, above Tm. Above TiS, the crystalline solid is once again expected to have an entropy greater than that of the liquid. Cahn3 has considered the implications of this idea with respect to the superheating of a solid. Here we present an alternative evaluation of the two temperatures of instability, Tk and TiS, from experimentally measurable parameters. Results for alkali metals show that the Kauzmann-type entropy catastrophe occurs at about half the absolute melting temperature, whereas we find that the entropy catastrophe as described by Fecht and Johnson2 occurs at twice the absolute melting temperature. For most solids, vaporization will probably intervene before the entropy catastrophe temperature above the melting temperature is reached.},

  abstract = {We present the results of a detailed molecular-dynamics study of relaxation in the van der Waals system ortho-terphenyl in the supercooled regime. The molecule is described by a simple rigid three-site model, with interactions between different molecules of the Lennard-Jones form. We find that the long-time ({$\alpha$}) relaxation, as determined from the intermediate scattering function, is well described by a Kohlrausch law. The zero-time amplitude of this process, often referred to as the ``nonergodicity parameter,'' which can be interpreted as a Debye-Waller factor, is seen to depart from a linear temperature dependence and seems to exhibit a ``singularity'' at a temperature substantially larger than the conventional glass transition temperature, in accord with neutron-scattering data, and as predicted by mode-coupling theory. We find that the observed anharmonic behavior around Tc, as well as the decay of the scattering functions, is equally evident from both orientational and translational correlations. The latter observation indicates that the structural changes that take place during {$\alpha$} relaxation are neither specifically orientational nor specifically translational. Investigation of the van Hove self-correlation for both center-of-mass and orientational motion reveals the existence of a strong non-Gaussian spatial dependence at intermediate times and of processes, even at low temperatures, that cannot be described as simple vibrational motion, and which consist of rapid reorientations of the molecules about their essentially frozen centers of mass. This motion may be related to the fast secondary mode seen in experiments.},

Einstein's theory of Brownian motion, however, is only applicable at long time scales. At short time scales, Brownian motion of a suspended particle is not completely random, due to the inertia of the particle and the surrounding fluid. Moreover, the thermal force exerted on a particle suspended in a liquid is not a white noise, but is colored. Recent experimental developments in optical trapping and detection have made this new regime of Brownian motion accessible. This review summarizes related theories and recent experiments on Brownian motion at short time scales, with a focus on the measurement of the instantaneous velocity of a Brownian particle in a gas and the observation of the transition from ballistic to diffusive Brownian motion in a liquid.},

The results indicate that both descriptive metadata elements and reuse types about LAMMPS are presented in incomplete and inconsistent ways, and this interferes with the values of scientific software, as a type of research data.

  abstract = {Phase-field models are widely adopted to study the void evolution problem, overcoming difficulties and drawbacks of the sharp boundary approach and rate theory. This paper focuses on improving the performance of the phase-field model of which the vacancy concentration is used as the single conserved order parameter. Following recent developments in these phase-field models, the void dynamic, or more precisely the void growth rate which plays a vital role in characterizing the microstructural evolution of irradiated materials, cannot be accurately reproduced. Moreover, the interfacial energy or the void-matrix interface modeled by the Ginzburg-type gradient energy term is usually characterized by an empirical coefficient that is quite difficult to determine. For these reasons, a general relation of the bulk free energy density, the coefficient of the gradient energy term and the interface width is analytically derived from the planar interface case, and then validated by the numerical simulation example of a single void evolution in molybdenum (Mo). The obtained void growth rate agrees well with the prediction of rate theory while the interface width is smaller than a critical value in the considered cases regardless of the shape of the free energy density. This study will not only help to construct the appropriate formulation of the bulk free energy density, but will also provide an easy method of calculating the corresponding gradient energy coefficient and selecting the grid size according to the pre-estimated interface width.},

Inner loops are generated automatically in C or Fortran at compile time, with optimizations adapted to each architecture. Assembly loops using SSE and 3DNow! Multimedia instructions are provided for x86 processors, resulting in exceptional performance on inexpensive PC workstations. The interface is simple and easy to use (no scripting language), based on standard command line arguments with self-explanatory functionality and integrated documentation. All binary files are independent of hardware endian and can be read by versions of GROMACS compiled using different floating-point precision. A large collection of flexible tools for trajectory analysis is included, with output in the form of finished Xmgr/Grace graphs. A basic trajectory viewer is included, and several external visualization tools can read the GROMACS trajectory format.

Despite this important change in the dynamics, the internal structure of the system remains disordered in the solid as well as the fluid phase. In this way jamming is quite different from crystallization, the other common way in which a fluid solidifies. Jamming is a paradigm for thinking about how many different types of fluids\textemdash{}from molecular liquids to macroscopic granular matter\textemdash{}develop rigidity. Here we review recent work on the jamming transition. We start with perhaps the simplest model: frictionless spheres interacting via repulsive finite-range forces at zero temperature. In this highly idealized case, the transition has aspects of both first- and second-order transitions. From studies of the normal modes of vibration for the marginally jammed solid, new physics has emerged for how a material can be rigid without having the elastic properties of a normal solid. We first survey the simulation data and theoretical arguments that have been proposed to understand this behavior. We then review work that has systematically gone beyond the ideal model to see whether the scenario developed there is more generally applicable. This includes work that examines the effect of nonspherical particles, friction, and temperature on the excitations and the dynamics. We briefly touch on recent laboratory experiments that have begun to make contact with simulations and theory.},

An Einstein formulation of rotational motion is presented, which supplements the commonly used Debye model. The latter is shown to break down at supercooled temperatures as the mechanism of molecular reorientation changes from small random steps to large infrequent orientational jumps. We find that the model system exhibits non-Gaussian behavior in translational and rotational motion, which strengthens upon supercooling. Examination of particle mobility reveals spatially heterogeneous dynamics in translation and rotation, with a strong spatial correlation between translationally and rotationally mobile particles. Application of the Einstein formalism to the analysis of translation-rotation decoupling results in a trend opposite to that seen in conventional approaches based on the Debye formalism, namely, an enhancement in the effective rate of rotational motion relative to translation upon supercooling.},

Nine polymorphs were accessed through the use of polymer-induced heteronucleation (PIHn) and solid-solid transformation at low temperature. Structural elucidation of six of these forms, in addition to the two previously known forms, makes FFA indisputably octamorphic. Although the structure of at least one other form of FFA remains elusive, the occurrence of most of these polymorphs under one crystallization condition through PIHn illustrates that a fine interplay exists among the kinetic factors that lead to phase selection in this NSAID.},

The method uses the basic Parrinello-Rahman (constant-stress) scheme, modified for the application to inhomogeneous systems. Since our computational cell contains only one interface with two-dimensional (2D) periodic border conditions, we are able to study isolated interfaces all the way up to melting. The interaction between boundaries which may lead to their annihilation at higher temperatures, which is a problem when 3D periodic borders are applied, is thus avoided. As an application, the method is used to study the stability of a grain boundary at high temperatures. Observations on a possible connection between grain-boundary migration and ``premelting'' are discussed.},

Although most studies focus on the accuracy of the simulation output compared to experimental data, such a comparison primarily tests the adequacy of the force field (i.e. the model). By contrast, the reliability of different simulation methodologies for predicting transport properties is the focus of this manuscript. Unfortunately, obtaining reproducible estimates of transport properties from molecular simulation is not as straightforward as static properties. Therefore, this manuscript discusses the best practices that should be followed to ensure that the simulation output is reliable, i.e. is a valid representation of the force field implemented. We also discuss procedures to use so that the results are reproducible (i.e. can be obtained by other researchers following the same methods and procedures). There are two classes by which transport properties are predicted: equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD). This manuscript presents the best practices for EMD, leaving NEMD for a future publication. As self-diffusivity and shear viscosity are the most prevalent transport properties found in the literature, the discussion will also be limited to these properties with the expectation that future publications will discuss best practices for thermal conductivity, ionic conductivity, and multicomponent diffusivity.},

  abstract = {The scientific community across all disciplines faces the same challenges of ensuring accessibility, reproducibility, and efficient comparability of scientific results. Computational neuroscience is a rapidly developing field, where reproducibility and comparability of research results have gained increasing interest over the past years. As the number of computational models of brain functions is increasing, we chose to address reproducibility using four previously published computational models of astrocyte excitability as an example. Although not conventionally taken into account when modeling neuronal systems, astrocytes have been shown to take part in a variety of in vitro and in vivo phenomena including synaptic transmission. Two of the selected astrocyte models describe spontaneous calcium excitability, and the other two neurotransmitter-evoked calcium excitability. We specifically addressed how well the original simulation results can be reproduced with a reimplementation of the models. Additionally, we studied how well the selected models can be reused and whether they are comparable in other stimulation conditions and research settings. Unexpectedly, we found out that three of the model publications did not give all the necessary information required to reimplement the models. In addition, we were able to reproduce the original results of only one of the models completely based on the information given in the original publications and in the errata. We actually found errors in the equations provided by two of the model publications; after modifying the equations accordingly, the original results were reproduced more accurately. Even though the selected models were developed to describe the same biological event, namely astrocyte calcium excitability, the models behaved quite differently compared to one another. Our findings on a specific set of published astrocyte models stress the importance of proper validation of the models against experimental wet-lab data from astrocytes as well as the careful review process of models. A variety of aspects of model development could be improved, including the presentation of models in publications and databases. Specifically, all necessary mathematical equations, as well as parameter values, initial values of variables, and stimuli used should be given precisely for successful reproduction of scientific results.},

We observe translational diffusion that is about 100 times faster at Tg + 3 K than the Stokes-Einstein prediction. Predictions from random first order transition theory and a dynamic facilitation approach are in reasonable agreement with our results; in these approaches, enhanced translational diffusion is associated with spatially heterogeneous dynamics. Self-diffusion controls crystallization in o-terphenyl for most of the supercooled liquid regime, but at temperatures below Tg + 10 K, the reported crystallization rate increases suddenly while the self-diffusion coefficient does not. This work and previous work on trisnaphthylbenzene both find a self-diffusion-controlled crystal growth regime and an enhancement in self-diffusion near Tg, suggesting that these phenomena are general characteristics of fragile low molecular weight glass formers. We discuss the width of the relaxation time distributions of o-terphenyl and trisnaphthylbenzene as they relate to the observation of enhanced translational diffusion.},

  abstract = {Crystal structure prediction involves a search of a complex configurational space for local minima corresponding to stable crystal structures, which can be performed efficiently using atom\textendash{}atom force fields for the assessment of intermolecular interactions. However, for challenging systems, the limitations in the accuracy of force fields prevent a reliable assessment of the relative thermodynamic stability of potential structures, while the cost of fully quantum mechanical approaches can limit applications of the methods. We present a method to rapidly improve force field lattice energies by correcting two-body interactions with a higher level of theory in a fragment-based approach and predicting these corrections with machine learning. Corrected lattice energies with commonly used density functionals and second order perturbation theory (MP2) all significantly improve the ranking of experimentally known polymorphs where the rigid molecule model is applicable. The relative lattice energies of known polymorphs are also found to systematically improve with the fragment corrections. Predicting two-body interactions with atom-centered symmetry functions in a Gaussian process is found to give highly accurate results using as little as 10\textendash{}20\% of the data for training, reducing the cost of the energy correction by up to an order of magnitude. The machine learning approach opens up the possibility of more widespread use of fragment-based methods in crystal structure prediction, whose increased accuracy at a low computational cost will benefit applications in areas such as polymorph screening and computer-guided materials discovery.},

It provides a large number of trajectory analysis capabilities including minimal root-mean-square-deviation calculations, secondary structure assignment, and the extraction of common order parameters. The package has a strong focus on interoperability with the wider scientific Python ecosystem, bridging the gap between MD data and the rapidly growing collection of industry-standard statistical analysis and visualization tools in Python.

  abstract = {We have measured in situ Raman spectra of SiO2 glass between room temperature through the glass transformation range to the supercooled liquid at 1950 K, using a new wire loop heating technique. These results provide valuable insights into the structural and dynamic behaviour of this prototype silicate system at magmatic temperatures. The principal low frequency Raman band in the glass shows an anomalous increase in frequency with increasing temperature, indicating that the average SiOSi angle narrows as temperature is increased, due to anharmonic vibrational effects. Configurational changes at temperatures above Tg result in further increases in the band frequency. These effects are responsible for the anomalous volume behaviour of SiO2 glass and supercooled liquid with increasing temperature, including the low thermal expansivity over most of the temperature range, and the occurrence of density maxima at low and high temperatures. From experiments on glasses with different fictive temperatures, there is an increase in the intensity of the 606 cm-1 band, due to an increase in the proportion of three-membered ring ``defect'' species in the glass above Tg. This indicates that structural relaxation in the liquid state is accompanied by Si \textemdash{} O \textemdash{} Si bond breaking and reforming reactions, consistent with the measured magnitude of the activation energy for viscous flow. This observation is combined with recent results on the mechanism of structural relaxation in silicate liquids to propose an energetic model for viscous relaxation in SiO2, involving O2- transfer via formation of a vSi intermediate. This model is then generalized to ternary aluminosilicate systems, to provide a rationalization for the observed viscosity maximum at constant silica content, in high silica rock-forming melt compositions.},

  abstract = {The glass transition \textendash{} an apparent amorphous solidification process \textendash{} is a central feature of the physical properties of soft materials such as polymers and colloids. A key element of this phenomenon is the observation of a broad spectrum of deviations from an Arrhenius temperature of dynamics in glass-forming liquids, with the extent of deviation quantified by the ``fragility'' of glass formation. The underlying origin of ``fragile'' glass formation and its dependence on molecular structure remain major open questions in condensed matter physics and soft materials science. Here we employ molecular dynamics simulations, together with a neural-network-biased genetic algorithm, to design and study model rigid molecules spanning a broad range of fragilities of glass formation. Results indicate that fragility of glass formation can be controlled by tuning molecular asphericity, with extended molecules tending to exhibit low fragilities and compact molecules tending toward higher fragilities. The glass transition temperature itself, on the other hand, correlates well with high-temperature activation behavior and with density. These results point the way towards rational design of glass-forming liquids spanning a range of dynamical behavior, both via these physical insights and via future extensions of this evolutionary design strategy to real chemistries. Finally, we show that results compare well with predictions of the nonlinear Langevin theory of liquid dynamics, which is a precursor of the more recently developed elastically collective nonlinear Langevin equation theory of Mirigian and Schweizer, identifying this framework as a promising basis for molecular design of the glass transition.},

We report the two-dimensional dense packing patterns of bending and assembled rods, which are non-convexly deformed from simple objects and modeled as entangled particles. Monte Carlo simulations and further analytical constructions are carried out to explore possible densely packed structures. Two typical densely packed structures of C-bending rods are found, and their packing densities are identified as being functions of the aspect ratio and central angle. Six shapes of assembled rods, representing the combined deformations of rods, are employed in simulations with the packing structures classified into three types. The dense packing density of each packing pattern is derived as a function of different shape parameters. In contrast with the case of disordered packings, both the shape and order are verified to affect the packing density.},

  abstract = {Advances in recent years have made molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations powerful tools in molecular-level research, allowing the prediction of experimental observables in the study of systems such as proteins, membranes, and polymeric materials. However, the quality of any prediction based on molecular dynamics results will strongly depend on the validity of underlying physical assumptions. Unphysical behavior of simulations can have significant influence on the results and reproducibility of these simulations, such as folding of proteins and DNA or properties of lipid bilayers determined by cutoff treatment, dynamics of peptides and polymers affected by the choice of thermostat, or liquid properties depending on the simulation time step. Motivated by such examples, we propose a two-fold approach to increase the robustness of molecular simulations. The first part of this approach involves tests which can be performed by the users of MD programs on their respective systems and setups. We present a number of tests of different complexity, ranging from simple post-processing analysis to more involved tests requiring additional simulations. These tests are shown to significantly increase the reliability of MD simulations by catching a number of common simulation errors violating physical assumptions, such as non-conservative integrators, deviations from the Boltzmann ensemble, and lack of ergodicity between degrees of freedom. To make the usage as easy as possible, we have developed an open-source and platform-independent Python library (https://physical-validation.readthedocs.io) implementing these tests. The second part of the approach involves testing for code correctness. While unphysical behavior can be due to poor or incompatible choices of parameters by the user, it can just as well originate in coding errors within the program. We therefore propose to include physical validation tests in the code-checking mechanism of MD software packages. We have implemented such a validation for the GROMACS software package, ensuring that every major release passes a number of physical sanity checks performed on selected representative systems before shipping. It is, to our knowledge, the first major molecular mechanics software package to run such validation routinely. The tests are, as the rest of the package, open source software, and can be adapted for other software packages.},

  abstract = {Neutron spin echo measurements have been performed on the mixed ionic system Ca0.4K0.6(NO3)1.4 around the glass transition temperature Tg in order to determine the time dependence of the density-density correlation function {$\phi$}q(t). This quantity plays a central role in recent mode-coupling theories of the glass transition in schematic models. On the liquid side of the transition our results reveal that there are two distinct slow relaxation processes. The faster one is situated in the 10-13-10-12s time domain. The second one (a) shows a rapid slowing down on T approaching the transition, which scales with the Stokes-Einstein diffusion constant (b) has a stretched exponential form exp (-(t/{$\tau$}){$\beta$}] with {$\beta$} {$\simeq$} 0.6 and (c) tends to become the non-ergodic fraction of the structure factor at the transition. The amplitude ratio of the second and the first relaxation steps varies between 3 and 6 in a smooth oscillatory fashion over the studied wave-number range of q = 0.1-2.1 {\AA}-1. These findings are in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions, but only if the theoretically relevant glass transition temperature T0 is assumed to lie considerably above the phenomenological glass temperature Tg. This implies that the theory breaks down at relaxation times longer than some 10-5s. In contrast, the q dependence of the characteristic time {$\tau$} of the slower relaxation step revealed a fully unexpected feature, a strong maximum at q0/2, where q0 is the position of the first peak in the structure factor. We propose that this slowing down of the mass density fluctuations reflects the maximum of the charge density structure factor. This new phenomenon is expected to allow the study of the static charge density correlations directly in the q space via the induced dynamic effects.},

Here, we discuss two fundamental flaws in the definition of these parameters that significantly affect their interpretation for studies of disordered systems, and offer a remedy. First, the definition of the bond-orientational order parameters considers the geometrical arrangement of a set of nearest neighboring (NN) spheres, NN(p), around a given central particle p; we show that the choice of neighborhood definition can have a bigger influence on both the numerical values and qualitative trend of ql than a change of the physical parameters, such as packing fraction. Second, the discrete nature of neighborhood implies that NN(p) is not a continuous function of the particle coordinates; this discontinuity, inherited by ql, leads to a lack of robustness of the ql as structure metrics. Both issues can be avoided by a morphometric approach leading to the robust Minkowski structure metrics q{${'}$}lq{${'}$}l{$<$}math overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00001.gif"{$><$}msubsup{$><$}mi{$>$}q{$<$}/mi{$><$}mi{$>$}l{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo{$>{'}<$}/mo{$><$}/msubsup{$><$}/math{$>$}.

A systematic LSA (including size dependence) was performed for a hard disk and 2D Lennard-Jones systems, simulated using Monte Carlo and molecular-dynamics methods. We find that the onset of freezing is accompanied by a dramatic crossover between ensembles of fluctuations. Some universal features related to the onset of freezing in two dimensions are found and corresponding freezing criteria are formulated: (i) the liquid starts to freeze when the concentration of solidlike atoms constitutes 0.50\textendash{}0.56, and (ii) a Lindemann-like freezing criterion: the rms fluctuation constitutes, at the onset, 0.12\textendash{}0.13. Those criteria offer an effective method for a localization of the onset of freezing in computer simulations. We point out, in this context, that in computer simulations there is a possibility that all quantitative characterizations of the onset of freezing are related to a metastable range. This important methodological topic is discussed briefly in the light of recent results both for 2D and 3D systems.},

  abstract = {The nucleation, growth, structure and melting of ice in 3 nm diameter hydrophilic nanopores are studied through molecular dynamics simulations with the mW water model. The melting temperature of water in the pore was T(m)(pore) = 223 K, 51 K lower than the melting point of bulk water in the model and in excellent agreement with experimental determinations for 3 nm silica pores. Liquid and ice coexist in equilibrium at the melting point and down to temperatures as low as 180 K. Liquid water is located at the interface of the pore wall, increasing from one monolayer at the freezing temperature, T(f)(pore) = 195 K, to two monolayers a few degrees below T(m)(pore). Crystallization of ice in the pore occurs through homogeneous nucleation. At the freezing temperature, the critical nucleus contains approximately 75 to 100 molecules, with a radius of gyration similar to the radius of the pore. The critical nuclei contain features of both cubic and hexagonal ice, although stacking of hexagonal and cubic layers is not defined until the nuclei reach approximately 150 molecules. The structure of the confined ice is rich in stacking faults, in agreement with the interpretation of X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments. Though the presence of cubic layers is twice as prevalent as hexagonal ones, the crystals should not be considered defective Ic as sequences with more than three adjacent cubic (or hexagonal) layers are extremely rare in the confined ice.},

  abstract = {We study thermodynamic and dynamic properties of a rigid model of the fragile glass-forming liquid orthoterphenyl. This model, introduced by Lewis and Wahnstr{\"o}m in 1993, collapses each phenyl ring to a single interaction site; the intermolecular site-site interactions are described by the Lennard-Jones potential whose parameters have been selected to reproduce some bulk properties of the orthoterphenyl molecule. A system of N=343 molecules is considered in a wide range of densities and temperatures, reaching simulation times up to 1{$\mu$}s. Such long trajectories allow us to equilibrate the system at temperatures below the mode coupling temperature Tc at which the diffusion constant reaches values of order 10-10cm2/s and thereby to sample in a significant way the potential energy landscape in the entire temperature range. Working within the inherent structures thermodynamic formalism, we present results for the temperature and density dependence of the number, depth and shape of the basins of the potential energy surface. We evaluate the total entropy of the system by thermodynamic integration from the ideal\textemdash{}noninteracting\textemdash{}gas state and the vibrational entropy approximating the basin free energy with the free energy of 6N-3 harmonic oscillators. We evaluate the configurational part of the entropy as a difference between these two contributions. We study the connection between thermodynamical and dynamical properties of the system. We confirm that the temperature dependence of the configurational entropy and of the diffusion constant, as well as the inverse of the characteristic structural relaxation time, are strongly connected in supercooled states; we demonstrate that this connection is well represented by the Adam-Gibbs relation, stating a linear relation between logD and the quantity 1/TSc. This relation is found to hold both above and below the critical temperature Tc\textemdash{}as previously found in the case of silica\textemdash{}supporting the hypothesis that a connection exists between the number of basins and the connectivity properties of the potential energy surface.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in molecular simulations allow the evaluation of previously unattainable observables, such as rate constants for protein folding. However, these calculations are usually computationally expensive, and even significant computing resources may result in a small number of independent estimates spread over many orders of magnitude. Such small-sample, high ``log-variance'' data are not readily amenable to analysis using the standard uncertainty (i.e., ``standard error of the mean'') because unphysical negative limits of confidence intervals result. Bootstrapping, a natural alternative guaranteed to yield a confidence interval within the minimum and maximum values, also exhibits a striking systematic bias of the lower confidence limit in log space. As we show, bootstrapping artifactually assigns high probability to improbably low mean values. A second alternative, the Bayesian bootstrap strategy, does not suffer from the same deficit and is more logically consistent with the type of confidence interval desired. The Bayesian bootstrap provides uncertainty intervals that are more reliable than those from the standard bootstrap method but must be used with caution nevertheless. Neither standard nor Bayesian bootstrapping can overcome the intrinsic challenge of underestimating the mean from small-size, high log-variance samples. Our conclusions are based on extensive analysis of model distributions and reanalysis of multiple independent atomistic simulations. Although we only analyze rate constants, similar considerations will apply to related calculations, potentially including highly nonlinear averages like the Jarzynski relation.},

The 17 participants were given only the chemical diagram for three organic molecules and were invited to test their prediction programs within a range of named common space groups. Several different computer programs were used, using the methodology wherein a molecular model is used to construct theoretical crystal structures in given space groups, and prediction is usually based on the minimum calculated lattice energy. A maximum of three predictions were allowed per molecule. The results showed two correct predictions for the first molecule, four for the second molecule and none for the third molecule (which had torsional flexibility). The correct structure was often present in the sorted low-energy lists from the participants but at a ranking position greater than three. The use of non-indexed powder diffraction data was investigated in a secondary test, after completion of the ab initio submissions. Although no one method can be said to be completely reliable, this workshop gives an objective measure of the success and failure of current methodologies.},

This glass-to-crystal (GC) mode can cause crystallization rates orders of magnitude faster than those predicted by standard models. While GC growth is known for 12 systems, its features vary greatly with growth rates spanning a factor of 104. We report that the general condition for GC growth to exist is that liquid diffusion be slow relative to crystal growth according to D/u {$<$} 7 pm. This condition holds for all liquids exhibiting GC growth and suggests that the phenomenon is a solid-state process terminated by fluidity. GC growth must solidify several molecular layers before rearrangement by diffusion. We propose that GC growth propagates by a nonequilibrium crystal/liquid interface 3 nm wide that solidifies by local mobility. These results explain the prevalence of GC growth among organic liquids and guide its discovery in other materials.},

In particular, we find that coupled orientational jump motions play an important role in all three cases. While CO and NO show similar features, CN- exhibits certain differences. Our results agree well with the known experimental values of the diffusion coefficient. We examined the validity of hydrodynamic predictions and found them to be inadequate, particularly for rotational diffusion.

Extending these basic methods with rigid body constraints enables composite particles with complex shapes such as anisotropic nanoparticles, grains, molecules, and rigid proteins to be modeled. Rigid body constraints are added to the GPU-accelerated MD package, HOOMD-blue, version 0.10.0. The software can now simulate systems of particles, rigid bodies, or mixed systems in microcanonical (NVE), canonical (NVT), and isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensembles. It can also apply the FIRE energy minimization technique to these systems. In this paper, we detail the massively parallel scheme that implements these algorithms and discuss how our design is tuned for the maximum possible performance. Two different case studies are included to demonstrate the performance attained, patchy spheres and tethered nanorods. In typical cases, HOOMD-blue on a single GTX 480 executes 2.5\textendash{}3.6 times faster than LAMMPS executing the same simulation on any number of CPU cores in parallel.

The study of their nucleation, growth, and decomposition using molecular simulations requires an accurate and efficient algorithm that distinguishes water molecules that belong to each of these crystals and the liquid phase. Existing algorithms identify ice or clathrates, but not both. This poses a challenge for cases in which ice and hydrate coexist, such as in the synthesis of clathrates from ice and the formation of ice from clathrates during self-preservation of methane hydrates. Here we present an efficient algorithm for the identification of clathrate hydrates, hexagonal ice, cubic ice, and liquid water in molecular simulations. CHILL+ uses the number of staggered and eclipsed water\textendash{}water bonds to identify water molecules in cubic ice, hexagonal ice, and clathrate hydrate. CHILL+ is an extension of CHILL (Moore et al. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2010, 12, 4124\textendash{}4134), which identifies hexagonal and cubic ice but not clathrates. In addition to the identification of hydrates, CHILL+ significantly improves the detection of hexagonal ice up to its melting point. We validate the use of CHILL+ for the identification of stacking faults in ice and the nucleation and growth of clathrate hydrates. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that allows for the simultaneous identification of ice and clathrate hydrates, and it does so in a way that is competitive with respect to existing methods used to identify any of these crystals.},

  abstract = {Relaxation times and transport processes of many glass-forming supercooled liquids exhibit a super-Arrhenius temperature dependence. We examine this phenomenon by computer simulation of the Lewis-Wahnstr{\"o}m model for ortho-terphenyl. We propose a microscopic definition for a single-molecule cage-breaking transition and show that, when correlation behaviour is taken into account, these rearrangements are sufficient to reproduce the correct translational diffusion constants over an intermediate temperature range in the supercooled regime. We show that super-Arrhenius behaviour can be attributed to increasing negative correlation in particle movement at lower temperatures and relate this to the cage-breaking description. Finally, we sample the potential energy landscape of the model and show that it displays hierarchical ordering. Substructures in the landscape, which may correspond to metabasins, have boundaries defined by cage-breaking transitions. The cage-breaking formulation provides a direct link between the potential energy landscape and macroscopic diffusion behaviour.},

  abstract = {We study the dynamical behaviour of a computer model for viscous silica, the archetypal strong glass former, and compare its diffusion mechanism with earlier studies of a fragile binary Lennard-Jones liquid. Three different methods of analysis are employed. First, the temperature and time scale dependence of the diffusion constant is analysed. Negative correlation of particle displacements influences transport properties in silica as well as in fragile liquids. We suggest that the difference between Arrhenius and super-Arrhenius diffusive behaviour results from competition between the correlation time scale and the caging time scale. Second, we analyse the dynamics using a geometrical definition of cage-breaking transitions that was proposed previously for fragile glass formers. We find that this definition accurately captures the bond rearrangement mechanisms that control transport in open network liquids, and reproduces the diffusion constants accurately at low temperatures. As the same method is applicable to both strong and fragile glass formers, we can compare correlation time scales in these two types of systems. We compare the time spent in chains of correlated cage breaks with the characteristic caging time and find that correlations in the fragile binary Lennard-Jones system persist for an order of magnitude longer than those in the strong silica system. We investigate the origin of the correlation behaviour by sampling the potential energy landscape for silica and comparing it with the binary Lennard-Jones model. We find no qualitative difference between the landscapes, but several metrics suggest that the landscape of the fragile liquid is rougher and more frustrated. Metabasins in silica are smaller than those in binary Lennard-Jones and contain fewer high-barrier processes. This difference probably leads to the observed separation of correlation and caging time scales.},

We classify the structural similarity of different energy minima using a measure of overlap. This analysis reveals a correspondence between distinct particle packings (which are characterised via the overlap) and funnels on the energy landscape (which are characterised via disconnectivity graphs). As the number of pinned particles is increased, we find a crossover from glassy behavior at low pinning to a structure-seeking landscape at high pinning, in which all thermally accessible minima are structurally similar. We discuss the consequences of these results for theories of randomly pinned liquids. We also investigate how the energy landscape depends on the fraction of pinned particles, including the degree of frustration and the evolution of distinct packings as the number of pinned particles is reduced.},

  abstract = {Published values of crystal growth rates are compared for supercooled glass-forming liquids undergoing congruent freezing at a planar crystal-liquid interface. For the purposes of comparison pure metals are considered to be glass-forming systems, using data from molecular-dynamics simulations. For each system, the growth rate has a maximum value Umax at a temperature Tmax that lies between the glass-transition temperature Tg and the melting temperature Tm. A classification is suggested, based on the lability (specifically, the propensity for fast crystallization), of the liquid. High-lability systems show ``fast'' growth characterized by a high Umax, a low Tmax\,/\,Tm, and a very broad peak in U vs. T\,/\,Tm. In contrast, systems showing ``slow'' growth have a low Umax, a high Tmax\,/\,Tm, and a sharp peak in U vs. T\,/\,Tm. Despite the difference of more than 11 orders of magnitude in Umax seen in pure metals and in silica, the range of glass-forming systems surveyed fit into a common pattern in which the lability increases with lower reduced glass-transition temperature (Tg\,/\,Tm) and higher fragility of the liquid. A single parameter, a linear combination of Tg\,/\,Tm and fragility, can show a good correlation with Umax. For all the systems, growth at Umax is coupled to the atomic/molecular mobility in the liquid. It is found that, across the diversity of glass-forming systems, Tmax\,/\,Tg = 1.48 {$\pm$} 0.15.},

A related dense packing is also discussed, which has a peak density of 0.7573 at a size ratio of 0.5147. This latter structure is the densest known noninterstitial compound packing when the mixture has three small spheres for every large sphere, at any size ratio.

To ascertain the interface effects, we investigate the dynamical and structural properties of two ILs in nanoscale confinement at various temperatures. Specifically, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations for ILs composed of 1-butyl-3methylimidazolium cations and hexafluorophosphate ([Bmim][PF6]) or tetrafluoroborate ([Bmim][BF4]) anions sandwiched between amorphous silica slabs. Analyses of the structure indicate a bilayered arrangement in the interfacial region and preferred cation orientation at the surface with the methyl groups pointing toward the wall and the butyl tails projected inward. Mean square displacements and incoherent scattering functions reveal slowed and heterogeneous dynamics of all ionic species in the slit pore. In particular, spatially resolved analyses show that the structural relaxation times increase by about 2 orders of magnitude when approaching the silica surfaces. The altered structural and dynamical features of the confined ILs can be related to an existence of preferred sites for the anions on the amorphous silica surfaces. Detailed analyses of relations between the broadly distributed site and the surface properties show that particularly stable anion sites result when triangular arrangements of silanol groups enable multiple hydrogen bonds with the various fluorine atoms of a given anion, elucidating an important trapping mechanism at the silica surface.},

Release 4.6 of GROMACS uses SIMD acceleration on a wide range of architectures, GPU offloading acceleration, and both OpenMP and MPI parallelism within and between nodes, respectively. The recent work on acceleration made it necessary to revisit the fundamental algorithms of molecular simulation, including the concept of neighborsearching, and we discuss the present and future challenges we see for exascale simulation - in particular a very fine-grained task parallelism.

Here, we propose a new structural parameter to characterize local atomic packing in metallic liquids.

It also exhibits significant spatial heterogeneities and these structural fluctuations show close correlation with the spatial distribution of the long-time dynamic propensities. Therefore, our results provide a direct evidence of the correlation between atomic structure and dynamical heterogeneity. The new structural parameter might be used to reflect the structural ``defect'' in metallic liquids and glasses and further play an important role to uncover the structure-property relationship in these disordered systems.},

  abstract = {Grain boundaries (GBs) influence a wide array of physical properties in polycrystalline materials and play an important role in governing microstructural evolution under extreme environments. While the importance of interfaces is well documented, their properties are among the least understood of all the defect types present in engineering material systems. This is due to the vast configurational space of interfaces, resulting in a diverse range of structures and properties. The complexity associated with GB structures is related to the different crystallographic degrees of freedom \textendash{} the misorientation, the boundary-plane orientation and the relative translations between the adjoining crystals. These unique challenges can be addressed by leveraging highthroughput simulations of GB properties and developing machine learning algorithms grounded in the concepts of bicrystallography of interfaces. To demystify the relationships between crystallography and properties, the symmetry aspects of GBs are reviewed with an emphasis on boundary-plane orientations and disconnection line defects. To quantify structure-property relationships, recent advances in describing GB structures using the polyhedral unit model and the gaussian-based approximation of local atomic environments are discussed. Finally, examples of predicting GB structure-property relationships using machine learning techniques are summarized. As part of a special issue, the goal of this review article is to motivate machine learning strategies that are informed by bicrystallography and novel structural descriptors for developing reliable crystallographystructure-property relationships for grain boundaries.},

In the crystal, the three spheres that make up the rigid molecule sit near sites of a body centered cubic lattice. The trimer bond angle is almost optimal for this structure. The crystal exhibits orientational disorder with the molecules aligned randomly along the three Cartesian axis, i.e., cubatic orientational order. The rotational and translational mobilities exhibit only modest decreases on crystallization, by factors of 10 and 3, respectively. The rotational relaxation does change from Debye-like in the liquid to large angle jumps in the crystal.

The definition and properties of strongly correlating liquids' isomorphs are given, and various isomorph invariants are discussed. The cause of strong virial/potential energy correlations is also discussed, and it is argued that strongly correlating liquids are not merely to be thought of as approximate inverse power-law liquids. The experimental predictions for strongly correlating glass-forming liquids include: i) density scaling; ii) isochronal superposition; iii) that there is a single function of frequency from which all frequency-dependent viscoelastic response functions may be calculated; iv) that strongly correlating liquids are approximately single-parameter liquids with close to unity Prigogine\textendash{}Defay ratio; v) that the fictive temperature initially decreases for an isobaric temperature up jump. The paper also briefly discusses the ``isomorph filter'', which provides a necessary condition for universality of theories for the non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of the relaxation time.},

Using these colloidal crystals as a model system, a great variety of problems of interest to materials science, physical chemistry, and condensed-matter physics have been investigated during the past two decades. Recently, it has been demonstrated2 that point defects can be created in two-dimensional colloidal crystals3 by manipulating individual particles with optical tweezers. Direct imaging of these defects verified that their stable configurations have lower symmetry than the underlying triangular lattice, as predicted by numerical simulations for a number of~two-dimensional systems4,5,6,7. It was also observed that point defects can dissociate into pairs of well-separated dislocations, a topological excitation especially important in two dimensions. Here we use a similar experimental system to study the dynamics of mono- and di-vacancies in two-dimensional colloidal crystals. We see evidence that the excitation of point defects into dislocation pairs enhances the diffusion of di-vacancies. Moreover, the hopping of the defects does not follow a pure random walk, but exhibits surprising memory effects. We expect the results presented in this work to be relevant for explaining the dynamics of other two-dimensional systems.},

NAMD scales to hundreds of processors on high-end parallel platforms, as well as tens of processors on low-cost commodity clusters, and also runs on individual desktop and laptop computers. NAMD works with AMBER and CHARMM potential functions, parameters, and file formats. This article, directed to novices as well as experts, first introduces concepts and methods used in the NAMD program, describing the classical molecular dynamics force field, equations of motion, and integration methods along with the efficient electrostatics evaluation algorithms employed and temperature and pressure controls used. Features for steering the simulation across barriers and for calculating both alchemical and conformational free energy differences are presented. The motivations for and a roadmap to the internal design of NAMD, implemented in C++ and based on Charm++ parallel objects, are outlined. The factors affecting the serial and parallel performance of a simulation are discussed. Finally, typical NAMD use is illustrated with representative applications to a small, a medium, and a large biomolecular system, highlighting particular features of NAMD, for example, the Tcl scripting language. The article also provides a list of the key features of NAMD and discusses the benefits of combining NAMD with the molecular graphics/sequence analysis software VMD and the grid computing/collaboratory software BioCoRE.

In the present contribution, we show that efficient and accurate prediction of a diverse set of properties of material systems is possible by employing machine (or statistical) learning methods trained on quantum mechanical computations in combination with the notions of chemical similarity. Using a family of one-dimensional chain systems, we present a general formalism that allows us to discover decision rules that establish a mapping between easily accessible attributes of a system and its properties. It is shown that fingerprints based on either chemo-structural (compositional and configurational information) or the electronic charge density distribution can be used to make ultra-fast, yet accurate, property predictions. Harnessing such learning paradigms extends recent efforts to systematically explore and mine vast chemical spaces and can significantly accelerate the discovery of new application-specific materials.},

  abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently--those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90\% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

To capture and persist the provenance and performance data of these workflows, we have designed and developed the Chimbuko and ProvEn frameworks. Chimbuko captures provenance and enables detailed single workflow performance analysis. ProvEn is a hybrid, queryable system for storing and analyzing the provenance and performance metrics of multiple runs in workflow performance analysis campaigns. Workflow provenance and performance data output from Chimbuko can be visualized in a dynamic, multilevel visualization providing overview and zoom-in capabilities for areas of interest. Provenance and related performance data ingested into ProvEn is queryable and can be used to reproduce runs. Our provenance-based approach highlights challenges in extracting information and gaps in the information collected. It is agnostic to the type of provenance data it captures so that both the reproducibility of scientific results and that of performance can be explored with our tools.},

  abstract = {Computing plays an indispensable role in scientific research. Presently, researchers in science have different problems, needs, and beliefs about computation than professional programmers. In order to accelerate the progress of science, computer scientists must understand these problems, needs, and beliefs. To this end, this paper presents a survey of scientists from diverse disciplines, practicing computational science at a doctoral-granting university with very high research activity. The survey covers many things, among them, prevalent programming practices within this scientific community, the importance of computational power in different fields, use of tools to enhance performance and software productivity, computational resources leveraged, and prevalence of parallel computation. The results reveal several patterns that suggest interesting avenues to bridge the gap between scientific researchers and programming tools developers.},

  abstract = {In this work, the relationship between grain boundary crystallography and grain boundary atomic structure is examined, using \textonehalf{}1 0 0¬ä - symmetric tilt grain boundaries in nickel. The structural unit model is used as a benchmark to evaluate the atomic structure description capacities of an emerging structural descriptor, the local environment representation, which itself is a refinement of the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptor. We show that the local environment representation encodes both the information of the structural unit model and additional information, such as distortion in the structural units and the arrangement of the structural units at the interface. The use of the local environment representation permits the use of a visualization tool known as SPRING to represent structural similarities between grain boundaries. With the SPRING representation, we produce objective evidence of a relationship between crystallography and atomic structure, at least for \textonehalf{}1 0 0¬ä - symmetric tilt grain boundaries.},

The height of the nucleation barrier has been determined by solving the appropriate Euler\textendash{}Lagrange equations.

Extending previous work for pure systems (Gr{\'a}n{\'a}sy et al 2007 Phys. Rev. Lett. 98 035703), heterogeneous nucleation in unary and binary systems is described via introducing boundary conditions that realize the desired contact angle. A quaternion representation of crystallographic orientation of the individual particles (outlined in Pusztai et al 2005 Europhys. Lett. 71 131) has been applied for modeling a broad variety of polycrystalline structures including crystal sheaves, spherulites and those built of crystals with dendritic, cubic, rhombo-dodecahedral and truncated octahedral growth morphologies. Finally, we present illustrative results for dendritic polycrystalline solidification obtained using an atomistic phase-field model.},

computational results with text narratives, mathematics, images, video
and any media that a modern browser can display. This interface can be
used not only in research, but also for publication and education, as
notebooks can be converted to a variety of output formats, including
HTML and PDF. Recent developments in the Jupyter project include a
multi-user environment for hosting notebooks for a class or research
group, a live collaboration notebook via Google Docs, and better support
for languages other than Python.},

The pair-correlation function and the constant of self-diffusion are found to agree well with experiment; the latter is 15\% lower than the experimental value. The spectrum of the velocity autocorrelation function shows a broad maximum in the frequency region {$\omega$}=0.25(kBT{$\hslash$}). The shape of the Van Hove function Gs(r, t) attains a maximum departure from a Gaussian at about t=3.0\texttimes{}10-12 sec and becomes a Gaussian again at about 10-11 sec. The Van Hove function Gd(r, t) has been compared with the convolution approximation of Vineyard, showing that this approximation gives a too rapid decay of Gd(r, t) with time. A delayed-convolution approximation has been suggested which gives a better fit with Gd(r, t); this delayed convolution makes Gd(r, t) decay as t4 at short times and as t at long times.},

Kinetic coefficient, one of the important parameters that controls solidification growth morphology, is calculated using free solidification method employing two different interatomic potentials. Compared to pure metals, the kinetic coefficients of the ordered systems are smaller by at least an order of magnitude. For the first time, we show here that the growth kinetics of ordered Ni3Al is very sluggish compared to that of the disordered system. The difference is attributed to the diffusion limited growth in the ordered systems vis-{\'a}-vis the interface limited growth in their counterpart. Theoretical models by Broughton-Gilmer-Jackson and Wilson-Frenkel are employed to corroborate the identified growth mechanisms. The extent of disorder trapped increases with increasing interface velocity.},

The code has been optimized for high performance in both serial and parallel cases. The model system is completely specified in a run-time input file and may contain atoms, molecules or ions in any mixture. Molecules or molecular ions are treated in the rigid-molecule approximation and their rotational motion is modeled using quaternion methods.

  abstract = {With more than a hundred elements in the periodic table, a large number of potential new materials exist to address the technological and societal challenges we face today; however, without some guidance, searching through this vast combinatorial space is frustratingly slow and expensive, especially for materials strongly influenced by processing. We train a machine learning (ML) model on previously reported observations, parameters from physiochemical theories, and make it synthesis method\textendash{}dependent to guide high-throughput (HiTp) experiments to find a new system of metallic glasses in the Co-V-Zr ternary. Experimental observations are in good agreement with the predictions of the model, but there are quantitative discrepancies in the precise compositions predicted. We use these discrepancies to retrain the ML model. The refined model has significantly improved accuracy not only for the Co-V-Zr system but also across all other available validation data. We then use the refined model to guide the discovery of metallic glasses in two additional previously unreported ternaries. Although our approach of iterative use of ML and HiTp experiments has guided us to rapid discovery of three new glass-forming systems, it has also provided us with a quantitatively accurate, synthesis method\textendash{}sensitive predictor for metallic glasses that improves performance with use and thus promises to greatly accelerate discovery of many new metallic glasses. We believe that this discovery paradigm is applicable to a wider range of materials and should prove equally powerful for other materials and properties that are synthesis path\textendash{}dependent and that current physiochemical theories find challenging to predict.

  abstract = {Non-exponential patterns are well known characteristics of relaxations in glassy systems; however, the origin of dispersion is a matter of debate in many cases. Dielectric relaxation and solvation dynamic data are compared along the lines of the mean spherical approximation theory for discriminating between homogeneous and heterogeneous nature of dispersion for a low molecular weight glass at 3 K above the glass transition temperature, TG. From the theoretical point of view, the necessary spatial component stems from the dependence of solvation dynamics on {$\epsilon$}({$\omega$}, {$\kappa$}), rather than the macroscopic limit {$\epsilon$}({$\omega$}, {$\kappa$} = 0). It is shown that the two origins of dispersion can be distinguished in terms of solvation data which agree with the homogeneous limit.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Approaches for computing small molecule binding free energies based on molecular simulations are now regularly being employed by academic and industry practitioners to study receptor-ligand systems and prioritize the synthesis of small molecules for ligand design. Given the variety of methods and implementations available, it is natural to ask how the convergence rates and final predictions of these methods compare. In this study, we describe the concept and results for the SAMPL6 SAMPLing challenge, the first challenge from the SAMPL series focusing on the assessment of convergence properties and reproducibility of binding free energy methodologies. We provided parameter files, partial charges, and multiple initial geometries for two octa-acid (OA) and one cucurbit[8]uril (CB8) host-guest systems. Participants submitted binding free energy predictions as a function of the number of force and energy evaluations for seven different alchemical and physical-pathway (i.e., potential of mean force and weighted ensemble of trajectories) methodologies implemented with the GROMACS, AMBER, NAMD, or OpenMM simulation engines. To rank the methods, we developed an efficiency statistic based on bias and variance of the free energy estimates. For the two small OA binders, the free energy estimates computed with alchemical and potential of mean force approaches show relatively similar variance and bias as a function of the number of energy/force evaluations, with the attach-pull-release (APR), GROMACS expanded ensemble, and NAMD double decoupling submissions obtaining the greatest efficiency. The differences between the methods increase when analyzing the CB8-quinine system, where both the guest size and correlation times for system dynamics are greater. For this system, nonequilibrium switching (GROMACS/NS-DS/SB) obtained the overall highest efficiency. Surprisingly, the results suggest that specifying force field parameters and partial charges is insufficient to generally ensure reproducibility, and we observe differences between seemingly converged predictions ranging approximately from 0.3 to 1.0 kcal/mol, even with almost identical simulations parameters and system setup (e.g., Lennard-Jones cutoff, ionic composition). Further work will be required to completely identify the exact source of these discrepancies. Among the conclusions emerging from the data, we found that Hamiltonian replica exchange - while displaying very small variance - can be affected by a slowly-decaying bias that depends on the initial population of the replicas, that bidirectional estimators are significantly more efficient than unidirectional estimators for nonequilibrium free energy calculations for systems considered, and that the Berendsen barostat introduces non-negligible artifacts in expanded ensemble simulations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

This was made possible by the use of a high-level language, Python, and of modern object-oriented programming techniques. The quantities that can be calculated by nMoldyn are the mean-square displacement, the velocity autocorrelation function as well as its Fourier transform (the density of states) and its memory function, the angular velocity autocorrelation function and its Fourier transform, the reorientational correlation function, and several functions specific to neutron scattering: the coherent and incoherent intermediate scattering functions with their Fourier transforms, the memory function of the coherent scattering function, and the elastic incoherent structure factor. The possibility to compute memory function is a new and powerful feature that allows to relate simulation results to theoretical studies. \textcopyright{} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The non-cooperative relaxation time fordensity fluctuations in OTP is found to have the sameactivation energy as the shear viscosity in the hightemperature limit.

The tantalizing colours of precious opals and the colour of some species of birds are examples of polycrystalline colloidal structures found in nature. Driven by the demands of several emergent technologies, efforts have been made to develop efficient, self-assembly-based methodologies for generating colloidal single crystals with well-defined morphologies. Somewhat unfortunately, these efforts are often frustrated by the formation of structures lacking long-range order. Here we show that the rational design of patch shape and symmetry can drive patchy colloids to crystallize in a single, selected morphology by structurally eliminating undesired polymorphs. We provide a proof of this concept through the numerical investigation of triblock Janus colloids. One particular choice of patch symmetry yields, via spontaneous crystallization, a pure tetrastack lattice, a structure with attractive photonic properties, whereas another one results in a colloidal clathrate-like structure, in both cases without any interfering polymorphs.},

A number of competing and often mutually exclusive theoretical approaches have been advanced to describe this phenomenon.

Other approaches are built around the concept of the glass transition as a primarily dynamic phenomenon. These fundamentally different interpretations give equally good descriptions of the data available, so it is hard to determine which\textemdash{}if any\textemdash{}is correct. Recently however this situation has begun to change.

A better understanding of this process would benefit many areas of science and technology such as medicine, biology, and atmospheric and material sciences. In the present work the temperature dependence of the rate of growth (melting) of the basal face of hexagonal ice Ih and the effect of system size are investigated in molecular dynamics simulations. Using an effective pair potential model of water, systems are studied over temperatures ranging from TM - 40 to TM +16 K, where TM is the melting temperature of the model. It is found that the growth rates reach a maximum value of 0.7 {\AA} ns-1 (7 cm s-1) at about 12 K below the melting temperature. A noticeable effect of the system size on the melting temperature and ice growth rates is observed; it is shown that the size effect arises in smaller systems due to the artificial ordering under periodic conditions. The decrease in melting entropy in the smallest system by 0.4 J (mol K)-1 relative to the largest system results in an up-shift in the melting temperature by about 2 K. An almost 60\% increase in the maximum growth rate is observed for the smallest system.},

  abstract = {Computational notebooks combine code, visualizations, and text in a single document. Researchers, data analysts, and even journalists are rapidly adopting this new medium. We present three studies of how they are using notebooks to document and share exploratory data analyses. In the first, we analyzed over 1 million computational notebooks on GitHub, finding that one in four had no explanatory text but consisted entirely of visualizations or code. In a second study, we examined over 200 academic computational notebooks, finding that although the vast majority described methods, only a minority discussed reasoning or results. In a third study, we interviewed 15 academic data analysts, finding that most considered computational notebooks personal, exploratory, and messy. Importantly, they typically used other media to share analyses. These studies demonstrate a tension between exploration and explanation in constructing and sharing computational notebooks. We conclude with opportunities to encourage explanation in computational media without hindering exploration.},

As a result of the weight adjustments, internal `hidden' units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure1.},

By computer simulations of the hard-sphere model we reveal the mechanism by which thermal fluctuations drive the transition from the supercooled liquid state to the crystal state. In particular we show that fluctuations in bond orientational order trigger the nucleation process, contrary to the common belief that the transition is initiated by density fluctuations. Moreover, the analysis of bond orientational fluctuations shows that these not only act as seeds of the nucleation process, but also i) determine the particular polymorph which is to be nucleated from them and ii) at high density favour the formation of fivefold structures which can frustrate the formation of crystals. These results can shed new light on our understanding of the relationship between crystallization and vitrification.},

  abstract = {Some liquids, if cooled rapidly enough to avoid crystallization, can be frozen into a nonergodic glassy state. The tendency for a material to form a glass when quenched is called ``glass-forming ability,'' and it is of key significance both fundamentally and for materials science applications. Here, we consider liquids with competing orderings, where an increase in the glass-forming ability is signaled by a depression of the melting temperature towards its minimum at triple or eutectic points. With simulations of two model systems where glass-forming ability can be tuned by an external parameter, we are able to interpolate between crystal-forming and glass-forming behavior. We find that the enhancement of the glass-forming ability is caused by an increase in the structural difference between liquid and crystal: stronger competition in orderings towards the melting point minimum makes a liquid structure more disordered (more complex). This increase in the liquid-crystal structure difference can be described by a single adimensional parameter, i.e., the interface energy cost scaled by the thermal energy, which we call the ``thermodynamic interface penalty.'' Our finding may provide a general physical principle for not only controlling the glass-forming ability but also the emergence of glassy behavior of various systems with competing orderings, including orderings of structural, magnetic, electronic, charge, and dipolar origin.},

By examining trends with \texttheta{}0, comparing these to the trends in trimers' jamming phenomenology, and then focusing on the six \texttheta{}0 that are commensurable with close-packed crystalline order, we obtain three key results: (i) the increase in trimers' solidification temperature Ts(\texttheta{}0) as they straighten (as \texttheta{}0 \textrightarrow{} 0\textdegree{}) is driven by the same gradual loss of effective configurational freedom that drives athermal trimers' decreasing {$\phi$}J(\texttheta{}0) [where {$\phi$}J(\texttheta{}0) is the packing fraction at jamming]; (ii) \texttheta{}0 that allow formation of both FCC and HCP order crystallize, while \texttheta{}0 that only allow formation of HCP order glass-form; and (iii) local cluster-level structure at temperatures slightly above Ts(\texttheta{}0) is highly predictive of whether trimers will crystallize or glass-form.},

This, in turn, prevents the successful reproduction of the analyses. Typical examples are missing scripts, incomplete datasets or specification of used software. Moreover, issues about licences often create legal concerns. This is true for the use of commercial software but also for the publication of research artefacts without proper sharing licence. As a result, the sole publication of research artefacts does not automatically result in reproducible research. To empirically confirm this, we have been systematically analysing research publications that also published their investigations as Jupyter notebooks. In this paper, we present preliminary results of this analysis for five publications. The results show, that the quality of the published research artefacts must be improved in order to assure reproducibility.},

Not all high-dimensional data exhibit these characteristics because many data sets have correlations, which led to the notion of intrinsic dimensionality. Intrinsic dimensionality describes the local behavior of data on a low-dimensional manifold within the higher dimensional space.We discuss this effect, and describe a surprisingly simple approach modification that allows us to reduce local intrinsic dimensionality of individual points. While this unlikely will be able to ``cure'' all problems associated with high dimensionality, we show the theoretical impact on idealized distributions and how to practically incorporate it into new, more robust, algorithms. To demonstrate the effect of this adjustment, we introduce the novel Intrinsic Stochastic Outlier Score (ISOS), and we propose modifications of the popular t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualization technique for intrinsic dimensionality, intrinsic t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (it-SNE).},

  abstract = {High-throughput density-functional calculations of solids are extremely time consuming. As an alternative, we here propose a machine learning approach for the fast prediction of solid-state prop-erties. To achieve this, LSDA calculations are used as training set. We focus on predicting metallic vs. insulating behavior, and on predicting the value of the density of electronic states at the Fermi energy. We find that conventional representations of the input data, such as the Coulomb matrix, are not suitable for the training of learning machines in the case of periodic solids. We propose a novel crystal structure representation for which learning and competitive prediction accuracies become possible within an unrestricted class of spd systems. Due to magnetic phenomena learning on d systems is found more difficult than in pure sp systems. In recent years ab-initio high-throughput computa-tional methods (HTM) have proven to be a powerful and successful tool to predict new materials and to optimize desired materials properties. Phase diagrams of multi-component crystals [1\textendash{}3] and alloys [4] have been suc-cessfully predicted. High-impact technological applica-tions have been achieved by improving the performance of Lithium based batteries [5\textendash{}7], by tailoring the non-linear optical response in organic molecules [8] for optical signal processing, by designing desired current-voltage characteristics [9] for photovoltaic materials, by optimiz-ing the electrode transparency and conductivity [10] for solar cell technology, and by screening metals for the highest amalgamation enthalpy [11] to efficiently remove Hg pollutants in coal gasification. However, the computational cost of electronic struc-ture calculations poses a serious bottleneck for HTM. Thinking of quaternary, quinternary, etc., compounds, the space of possible materials becomes so large, and the complexity of the unit cells so high that, even within ef-ficient Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT), a systematic high-throughput exploration grows beyond reach for present-day computing facilities. As a way out, one would like to have a more direct way to access the physical property of interest without actually solving the KS-DFT equations. Machine learning (ML) techniques offer an attractive possibility of this type. ML-based cal-culations are very fast, typically requiring only fractions of a second to predict a specific property of a given ma-terial, after having trained the ML model on a represen-tative training set of materials. ML methods rely on two main ingredients, the learn-ing algorithm itself and the representation of the input data. There are many different ways of representing a given material or compound. While, from the physicists point of view, the information is simply given by the charges and the positions of the nuclei, for ML algorithms},

Theoretical analyses relate this breakdown with the presence of heterogeneous dynamics, and by extension, with the fragility of glass formers. We perform an investigation of the breakdown of the SE relation in 2, 3, and 4 dimensions in order to understand these interrelations. Results from simulations of model glass formers show that the degree of the breakdown of the SE relation decreases with increasing spatial dimensionality. The breakdown itself can be rationalized via the difference between the activation free energies for diffusivity and viscosity (or relaxation times) in the Adam-Gibbs relation in three and four dimensions. The behavior in two dimensions also can be understood in terms of a generalized Adam-Gibbs relation that is observed in previous work. We calculate various measures of heterogeneity of dynamics and find that the degree of the SE breakdown and measures of heterogeneity of dynamics are generally well correlated but with some exceptions. The two-dimensional systems we study show deviations from the pattern of behavior of the three- and four-dimensional systems both at high and low temperatures. The fragility of the studied liquids is found to increase with spatial dimensionality, contrary to the expectation based on the association of fragility with heterogeneous dynamics.},

Patterns of gene expression can be used to characterize and classify neuronal types. It is challenging, however, to generate taxonomies that fulfill the essential criteria of being comprehensive, harmonizing with conventional classification schemes, and lacking superfluous subdivisions of genuine types. To address these challenges, we used massively parallel single-cell RNA profiling and optimized computational methods on a heterogeneous class of neurons, mouse retinal bipolar cells (BCs). From a population of {$\sim$}25,000 BCs, we derived a molecular classification that identified 15 types, including all types observed previously and two novel types, one of which has a~non-canonical morphology and position. We validated the classification scheme and identified dozens of novel markers using methods that match molecular expression to cell morphology. This work provides a systematic methodology for achieving comprehensive molecular classification of neurons, identifies novel neuronal types, and uncovers transcriptional differences that distinguish types within a class.},

The algorithm is an extension of rigid-body dynamics [Matubayasi and Nakahara, J Chem Phys 1999, 110, 3291] to the NPT ensemble on the basis of non-Hamiltonian statistical mechanics [Martyna, G. J. et al., J Chem Phys 1994, 101, 4177]. A series of MD simulations of water as well as fully hydrated lipid bilayer systems have been undertaken to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm. The rRB algorithm was shown to be superior to the state-of-the-art constraint-dynamics algorithm SHAKE/RATTLE/ROLL, with respect to computational efficiency. However, it was revealed that both algorithms produced accurate trajectories of molecules in the NPT as well as NVT ensembles, as long as a reasonably short time step was used. A couple of multiple time-step (MTS) integration schemes were also examined. The advantage of the rRB algorithm for computational efficiency increased when the MD simulation was carried out using MTS on parallel processing computer systems; total computer time for MTS-MD of a lipid bilayer using 64 processors was reduced by about 40\% using rRB instead of SHAKE/RATTLE/ROLL.},

To date, sphere packings have been extensively studied in many previous works, where isostaticity at the transition and scaling laws with the pressure of various quantities, including the contact number and the vibrational density of states, have been established. Additionally, much attention has been paid to nonspherical packings, and particularly recent work has made progress in understanding ellipsoidal packings. In this work, we study the dimer packings in two dimensions, which have been much less understood than systems of spheres and ellipsoids. We first study the contact number of dimers near the jamming transition. It turns out that packings of dimers have ``rotational rattlers,'' each of which still has a free rotational motion. After correcting this effect, we show that dimers become isostatic at the jamming, and the excess contact number obeys the same critical law and finite-size scaling law as those of spheres. We next study the vibrational properties of dimers near the transition. We find that the vibrational density of states of dimers exhibits two characteristic plateaus that are separated by a peak. The high-frequency plateau is dominated by the translational degree of freedom, while the low-frequency plateau is dominated by the rotational degree of freedom. We establish the critical scaling laws of the characteristic frequencies of the plateaus and the peak near the transition. In addition, we present detailed characterizations of the real space displacement fields of vibrational modes in the translational and rotational plateaus.},

The application of a background subtraction and two different baseline correction methods to the scattering profiles is assessed, along with three different methods to analyse the processed data. The choice of baseline correction method is shown to have a significant effect: an offset to zero overestimates the order parameters from the experimental and calculated data sets, particularly for lower order parameters arising from broad distributions, whereas an offset to a value estimated from regions of low scattering intensity provides experimental values close to those reported from other experimental techniques. By contrast, the three different analysis methods are shown generally to result in relatively small absolute differences between the order parameters. We outline a straightforward general approach to experimental X-ray scattering data processing and analysis for uniaxial phases that results in order parameters that match well with those reported using other experimental techniques.},

JOSS is a free and open-access journal that publishes articles describing research software. It has the dual goals of improving the quality of the software submitted and providing a mechanism for research software developers to receive credit. While designed to work within the current merit system of science, JOSS addresses the dearth of rewards for key contributions to science made in the form of software. JOSS publishes articles that encapsulate scholarship contained in the software itself, and its rigorous peer review targets the software components: functionality, documentation, tests, continuous integration, and the license. A JOSS article contains an abstract describing the purpose and functionality of the software, references, and a link to the software archive. The article is the entry point of a JOSS submission, which encompasses the full set of software artifacts. Submission and review proceed in the open, on GitHub. Editors, reviewers, and authors work collaboratively and openly. Unlike other journals, JOSS does not reject articles requiring major revision; while not yet accepted, articles remain visible and under review until the authors make adequate changes (or withdraw, if unable to meet requirements). Once an article is accepted, JOSS gives it a DOI, deposits its metadata in Crossref, and the article can begin collecting citations on indexers like Google Scholar and other services. Authors retain copyright of their JOSS article, releasing it under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. In its first year, starting in May 2016, JOSS published 111 articles, with more than 40 additional articles under review.

Using these tools, reference implementations have been created for a number of methods, including self-consistent field (SCF), SCF response, many-body perturbation theory, coupled-cluster theory, configuration interaction, and symmetry-adapted perturbation theory. Furthermore, several reference codes have been integrated into Jupyter notebooks, allowing background, underlying theory, and formula information to be associated with the implementation. Psi4NumPy tools and associated reference implementations can lower the barrier for future development of quantum chemistry methods. These implementations also demonstrate the power of the hybrid C++/Python programming approach employed by the Psi4 program.},

In lipid membranes research, particle-based molecular simulations are a powerful tool alongside continuum theory, lipidomics, and model, in vitro, and in vivo experiments. Molecular simulations can provide precise and reproducible spatiotemporal (atomic- and femtosecond-level) information about membrane structure, mechanics, thermodynamics, kinetics, and dynamics. Yet the simulation of lipid membranes can be a daunting task, given the uniqueness of lipid membranes relative to conventional liquid-liquid and solid-liquid interfaces, the immense and complex thermodynamic and statistical mechanical theory, the diversity of multiscale lipid models, limitations of modern computing power, the difficulty and ambiguity of simulation controls, finite size effects, competitive continuum simulation alternatives, and the desired application, including vesicle experiments and biological membranes. These issues can complicate an essential understanding of the field of lipid membranes, and create major bottlenecks to simulation advancement. In this article, we clarify these issues and present a consistent, thorough, and user-friendly framework for the design of state-of-the-art lipid membrane MD simulations. We hope to allow early-career researchers to quickly overcome common obstacles in the field of lipid membranes and reach maximal impact in their simulations.},

We focus primarily on the regression of ``double error'' data, or x-y data pairs, where both variables are measurements subject to error (e.g., isochron fitting), but the methods we discuss are general and can be applied to any nonlinear regression. We review the differences between least squares and maximum likelihood methods and describe how maximum likelihood can be naturally extended to permit robust regressions that are relatively insensitive to outliers. We describe the bootstrap technique for the estimation of the standard error and confidence intervals of a model and show how it can be used to sidestep the mathematical intractability of estimating uncertainty in nonlinear regressions. We illustrate the application of these methods through examples using synthetic and real data and demonstrate how they can influence statistical perception of nonlinear parameter estimates. In particular, we demonstrate how the linearized methods that are commonly used to make uncertainty estimates can substantially underestimate model error, and we show how this problem can be addressed with bootstrap confidence intervals that automatically adjust to account for intrinsic asymmetry and non-Gaussian behavior in a regression. We include computer code to implement the calculations we describe as supplements to this article.},

By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License.

The order is predominantly icosahedral, although there is also a cubic component which we attribute to the periodic boundary conditions. Results are obtained for liquids cooled in an icosahedral pair potential as well. Only a modest amount of orientational order appears in a relaxed Finney dense-random-packing model.

This growth mode, termed GC (glass-crystal), is so fast that it is not limited by molecular diffusion in the bulk liquid. We have studied the GC mode by growing seven polymorphs from the liquid of ROY, currently the top system for the number of coexisting polymorphs of known structures. Some polymorphs did not show GC growth, while others did, with the latter having higher density and more isotropic molecular packing. The polymorphs not showing GC growth grew as compact spherulites at all temperatures; their growth rates near Tg decreased smoothly with falling temperature. The polymorphs showing GC growth changed growth morphologies with temperature, from faceted single crystals near the melting points, to fiber-like crystals near Tg, and to compact spherulites in the GC mode; in the GC mode, they grew at rates 3-4 orders of magnitude faster with activation energies 2-fold smaller than the polymorphs not showing GC growth. The GC mode had rates and activation energies similar to those of a polymorphic transformation observed near Tg. The GC mode was disrupted by the onset of the liquid's structural relaxation but could persist well above Tg (up to 1.15 Tg) in the form of fast-growing fibers. We consider various explanations for the GC mode and suggest that it is solid-state transformation enabled by local molecular motions native to the glassy state and disrupted by the liquid's structural relaxation (the {$\alpha$} process).},

  abstract = {The crystal nucleation from liquid in most cases is too rare to be accessed within the limited time scales of the conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Here, we developed a ``persistent embryo'' method to facilitate crystal nucleation in MD simulations by preventing small crystal embryos from melting using external spring forces. We applied this method to the pure Ni case for a moderate undercooling where no nucleation can be observed in the conventional MD simulation, and obtained nucleation rate in good agreement with the experimental data. Moreover, the method is applied to simulate an even more sluggish event: the nucleation of the B2 phase in a strong glass-forming Cu-Zr alloy. The nucleation rate was found to be 8 orders of magnitude smaller than Ni at the same undercooling, which well explains the good glass formability of the alloy. Thus, our work opens a new avenue to study solidification under realistic experimental conditions via atomistic computer simulation.},

Here we consider whether such suppression of crystallization has a kinetic or thermodynamic nature and investigate its mechanism. We introduce a model in which the degree of fivefold symmetry can be tuned by favouring arrangements of particles in pentagonal bipyramids. We thus show that fivefold symmetry has both kinetic and thermodynamic effects on the mechanism of crystallization to a face-centred cubic crystal. Our results suggest that the mechanism of crystallization suppression is related to the surface tension between fluid and crystal. Interestingly, the degree of fivefold symmetry has little effect on crystal growth rate, suggesting that growth may be only weakly coupled to fluid structure in hard sphere like systems. Upon increasing the fivefold symmetry, we find a first-order transition to an alternative icosahedra-rich phase. At intermediate bias strengths we find a one-component glassformer.},

In particular, the focus was on the recently observed phenomenon of unusual overgrowth during the directional solidification of a Ni-based superalloy, where the favorably oriented (FO) dendrites are overgrown by the unfavorably oriented (UO) ones. The phase-field simulations were accelerated by parallel computations on graphics processing units. The simulation results showed that unusual overgrowth occurs in Al\textendash{}Cu alloys, indicating that this phenomenon is a common one in metallic materials. It was also concluded that the differences in the diffusion layers in front of the FO and UO dendrites had a dominant effect on the competitive growth of dendrites at the converging GB as well as on the unusual overgrowth. In addition, unusual overgrowth was observed in all the FO dendrites with a spacing that allowed the dendrite array to grow stably without necessitating a change in the number of dendrites. The FO dendrite at the GB is overgrown by the UO dendrite when the spacing between the FO dendrite at the GB and the next FO dendrite is approximately equal to the critical minimum spacing. However, the unusual overgrowth was not observed for UO dendrites with a large inclination angle. In this case, all the UO dendrites are blocked by the FO dendrite at the GB, and the FO dendrites migrate toward the UO dendrites.},

  abstract = {There are at least three fundamental states of matter, depending upon temperature and pressure: gas, liquid, and solid (crystal). These states are separated by first-order phase transitions between them. In both gas and liquid phases a complete translational and rotational symmetry exist, whereas in a solid phase both symmetries are broken. In intermediate phases between liquid and solid, which include liquid crystal and plastic crystal phases, only one of the two symmetries is preserved. Among the fundamental states of matter, the liquid state is the most poorly understood. We argue that it is crucial for a better understanding of liquids to recognize that a liquid generally has the tendency to have a local structural order and its presence is intrinsic and universal to any liquid. Such structural ordering is a consequence of many-body correlations, more specifically, bond angle correlations, which we believe are crucial for the description of the liquid state. We show that this physical picture may naturally explain difficult unsolved problems associated with the liquid state, such as anomalies of water-type liquids (water, Si, Ge, ...), liquid-liquid transition, liquid-glass transition, crystallization and quasicrystal formation, in a unified manner. In other words, we need a new order parameter representing a low local free-energy configuration, which is a bond orientational order parameter in many cases, in addition to a density order parameter for the physical description of these phenomena. Here we review our two-order-parameter model of liquid and consider how transient local structural ordering is linked to all of the above-mentioned phenomena. The relationship between these phenomena is also discussed.Graphical abstract Open image in new window},

  abstract = {Liquids are often assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic at any lengthscale and translationally invariant. The standard liquid-state theory is constructed on the basis of this picture and thus basically described in terms of the two-body density correlation. This picture is certainly valid at rather high temperatures, where a liquid is in a highly disordered state. However, it may not necessarily be valid at low temperatures or for a system which has strong directional bonding. Indeed, there remain fundamental unsolved problems in liquid science, which are difficult to explain by such a theory. They include water's thermodynamic and kinetic anomalies, liquid\textendash{}liquid transitions, liquid\textendash{}glass transitions, and liquid\textendash{}solid transitions. We argue that for the physical description of these phenomena it is crucial to take into account many-body (orientational) correlations, which have been overlooked in the conventional liquid-state theory. It is essential to recognise that a liquid can lower its free energy by local or mesoscopic ordering without breaking global symmetry. Since such ordering must involve at least a central particle and its neighbours, which are more than two particles, it is intrinsically a consequence of many-body correlations. Particularly important ordering is associated with local breakdown of rotational symmetry, i.e., bond orientational ordering. We emphasize that translational ordering is global whereas orientational ordering can be local. Because of the strong first-order nature of translational ordering, its growth in a liquid state is modest. Thus any structural ordering in a liquid should be associated primarily with orientational ordering and not with translational ordering. We show that bond orientational ordering indeed plays a significant role in all the above-mentioned phenomena at least for (quasi-)single-component liquids. In this Introductory Lecture, we discuss how these phenomena can be explained by such local or mesoscopic ordering in a unified manner.},

So far, the established empirical correlations of GFA (ref. ) are statistical guides at best and lack a microscopic rationale. Although simulations have the potential to provide this physical insight into the maximum crystallization rate, crystal nucleation is often too slow to be observed. In contrast, measuring the growth rate of a planar crystal surface represents an accessible route to understanding ordering kinetics. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to show that the crystal growth rate for an important binary glass former, CuZr, is significantly slower than that of a poor glass former, NiAl. In accounting for this difference, we find that the crystal/liquid interface in NiAl exhibits a significantly greater width than that of CuZr. Our results suggest that the crystal/liquid interfacial structure exerts an important influence on the GFA of alloys.},

  abstract = {Understanding the characteristics of jammed particle packings provides basic insights into the structure and bulk properties of crystals, glasses, and granular media and into selected aspects of biological systems. This review describes the diversity of jammed configurations attainable by frictionless convex nonoverlapping (hard) particles in Euclidean spaces and for that purpose it stresses individual-packing geometric analysis. A fundamental feature of that diversity is the necessity to classify individual jammed configurations according to whether they are locally, collectively, or strictly jammed. Each of these categories contains a multitude of jammed configurations spanning a wide and (in the large system limit) continuous range of intensive properties, including packing fraction {$\phi$}, mean contact number Z, and several scalar order metrics. Application of these analytical tools to spheres in three dimensions (an analog to the venerable Ising model) covers a myriad of jammed states, including maximally dense packings (as Kepler conjectured), low-density strictly jammed tunneled crystals, and a substantial family of amorphous packings. With respect to the last of these, the current approach displaces the historically prominent but ambiguous idea of ``random close packing'' with the precise concept of ``maximally random jamming.'' Both laboratory procedures and numerical simulation protocols can and, frequently, have been used for creation of ensembles of jammed states. But while the resulting distributions of intensive properties may individually approach narrow distributions in the large system limit, the distinguishing varieties of possible operational details in these procedures and protocols lead to substantial variability among the resulting distributions, some examples of which are presented here. This review also covers recent advances in understanding jammed packings of polydisperse sphere mixtures, as well as convex nonspherical particles, e.g., ellipsoids, ``superballs,'' and polyhedra. Because of their relevance to error-correcting codes and information theory, sphere packings in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces have been included as well. Some remarks are also made about packings in (curved) non-Euclidean spaces. In closing this review, several basic open questions for future research to consider have been identified.},

  abstract = {We apply a simple dynamical density functional theory, the phase-field crystal (PFC) model of overdamped conservative dynamics, to address polymorphism, crystal nucleation, and crystal growth in the diffusion-controlled limit. We refine the phase diagram for 3D, and determine the line free energy in 2D and the height of the nucleation barrier in 2D and 3D for homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation by solving the respective Euler\textendash{}Lagrange (EL) equations. We demonstrate that, in the PFC model, the body-centered cubic (bcc), the face-centered cubic (fcc), and the hexagonal close-packed structures (hcp) compete, while the simple cubic structure is unstable, and that phase preference can be tuned by changing the model parameters: close to the critical point the bcc structure is stable, while far from the critical point the fcc prevails, with an hcp stability domain in between. We note that with increasing distance from the critical point the equilibrium shapes vary from the sphere to specific faceted shapes: rhombic dodecahedron (bcc), truncated octahedron (fcc), and hexagonal prism (hcp). Solving the equation of motion of the PFC model supplied with conserved noise, solidification starts with the nucleation of an amorphous precursor phase, into which the stable crystalline phase nucleates. The growth rate is found to be time dependent and anisotropic; this anisotropy depends on the driving force. We show that due to the diffusion-controlled growth mechanism, which is especially relevant for crystal aggregation in colloidal systems, dendritic growth structures evolve in large-scale isothermal single-component PFC simulations. An oscillatory effective pair potential resembling those for model glass formers has been evaluated from structural data of the amorphous phase obtained by instantaneous quenching. Finally, we present results for eutectic solidification in a binary PFC model.},

Whether or not the melt of a given material forms a glass is determined principally by a set of factors which can be specified to some extent in the laboratory, namely, the cooling rate, - T, the liquid volume, v], and the seed density, ps and upon a set of materials constants: the reduced crystal\textendash{}liquid interfacial tension, {$\alpha$} the fraction, f, of acceptor sites in the crystal surface, and the reduced glass temperature, Trg . The glass-forming tendency will be greater the larger are - T and Trg and the smaller are v]. ps, and f. The number and variety of substances which have been prepared in a glassy or `amorphous solid' form have been greatly increased with techniques in which the material is condensed from solution on to a surface held well below its glass temperature. There are at least some glass formers in every category of material, according to bond type, i.e. covalent, ionic, metallic, van der Waals or hydrogen. However, it is not established whether or not every substance can be put into a glass form.},

Here we review the current understanding of the transition to jamming and the nature of the jammed state for disordered packings of particles that act through repulsive contact interactions and are at zero temperature and zero shear stress. We first discuss the breakdown of affine assumptions that underlies the rich mechanics near jamming. We then extensively discuss jamming of frictionless soft spheres. At the jamming point, these systems are marginally stable (isostatic) in the sense of constraint counting, and many geometric and mechanical properties scale with distance to this jamming point. Finally we discuss current explorations of jamming of frictional and non-spherical (ellipsoidal) particles. Both friction and asphericity tune the contact number at jamming away from the isostatic limit, but in opposite directions. This allows one to disentangle distance to jamming and distance to isostaticity. The picture that emerges is that most quantities are governed by the contact number and scale with distance to isostaticity, while the contact number itself scales with distance to jamming.},

  abstract = {A modern biomedical research project can easily contain hundreds of analysis steps and lack of reproducibility of the analyses has been recognized as a severe issue. While thorough documentation enables reproducibility, the number of analysis programs used can be so large that in reality reproducibility cannot be easily achieved. Literate programming is an approach to present computer programs to human readers. The code is rearranged to follow the logic of the program, and to explain that logic in a natural language. The code executed by the computer is extracted from the literate source code. As such, literate programming is an ideal formalism for systematizing analysis steps in biomedical research. We have developed the reproducible computing tool Lir (literate, reproducible computing) that allows a tool-agnostic approach to biomedical data analysis. We demonstrate the utility of Lir by applying it to a case study. Our aim was to investigate the role of endosomal trafficking regulators to the progression of breast cancer. In this analysis, a variety of tools were combined to interpret the available data: a relational database, standard command-line tools, and a statistical computing environment. The analysis revealed that the lipid transport related genes LAPTM4B and NDRG1 are coamplified in breast cancer patients, and identified genes potentially cooperating with LAPTM4B in breast cancer progression. Our case study demonstrates that with Lir, an array of tools can be combined in the same data analysis to improve efficiency, reproducibility, and ease of understanding. Lir is an open-source software available at github.com/borisvassilev/lir.},

The topology of the network of states formed is analyzed by employing graph-theoretical concepts. It is found that the network of the inherent structures visited by the system in the course of physical aging has both a scale-free and a small-world character. There exist minima acting as highly connected hubs in the network and trench-like sequences of states driving the system from one hub to another. In contrast to previous studies of scale-free networks in other branches of science, where the topology results from the static connectivity of the network's entities, this network is created by adding one-by-one the inherent structures traversed by the system during its evolution in time.},

Two different regimes of viscous behavior are found in the time window accessible in MD simulation studies (of the order of nanoseconds if units appropriate for argon are used). The results for the time dependence of the self-intermediate scattering function Fs(q,t) show two different slow relaxation processes, where the slowest ({$\alpha$} relaxation) can be represented by a stretched exponential, exp[-(t/{$\tau$}rel){$\beta$}]. In the frequency domain this gives rise to a quasielastic peak, and it is found that its area, the nonergodicity parameter fs(q)==a, shows an anomalous decrease when increasing the temperature towards a critical value Tc. This happens in the supercooled-liquid regime, and it is one of the basic predictions of the recent mode-coupling theory for the liquid-glass transition problem. In the strongly supercooled-liquid regime the diffusion is of the hopping type, and it is found to be strongly cooperative in nature.},

Treating the high dimensionality of molecular and condensed matter systems of contemporary interest is important for understanding how emergent properties are encoded in the landscape and for calculating these properties while faithfully representing barriers between different morphologies. The pathways characterized in full dimensionality, which are used to construct kinetic transition networks, may prove useful in guiding such calculations. The energy landscape perspective has also produced new procedures for structure prediction and analysis of thermodynamic properties. Basin-hopping global optimization, with alternative acceptance criteria and generalizations to multiple metric spaces, has been used to treat systems ranging from biomolecules to nanoalloy clusters and condensed matter. This review also illustrates how all this methodology, developed in the context of chemical physics, can be transferred to landscapes defined by cost functions associated with machine learning.},

In its first application to the self intermediate scattering function (SISF), V-T theory produced an accurate account of molecular dynamics (MD) data at all wave numbers q and time t. Recently, analysis of the mean square displacement (MSD) resolved a crossover behavior that was not observed in the SISF study. Our purpose here is to apply the more accurate MSD calibration to the SISF, and assess the results. We derive and discuss the theoretical equations for vibrational and transit contributions to the SISF. The time evolution is divided into three successive intervals: the vibrational interval when the vibrational contribution alone accurately accounts for the MD data; the crossover when the vibrational contribution saturates and the transit contribution becomes resolved; and the diffusive interval when the transit contribution alone accurately accounts for the MD data. The resulting theoretical error is extremely small at all q and t. V-T theory is compared to mode-coupling theories for the MSD and SISF, and to recent developments in Brownian motion experiments and theory.},

The scope of applications is limited due to the small thickness in the region of only tens of microns. The research effort in the past two decades, mainly pioneered by a Japanese- and a US-group of scientists, has substantially relaxed this size constrain. Some bulk metallic glasses can have tensile strength up to 3000MPa with good corrosion resistance, reasonable toughness, low internal friction and good processability. Bulk metallic glasses are now being used in consumer electronic industries, sporting goods industries, etc. In this paper, the authors reviewed the recent development of new alloy systems of bulk metallic glasses. The properties and processing technologies relevant to the industrial applications of these alloys are also discussed here. The behaviors of bulk metallic glasses under extreme conditions such as high pressure and low temperature are especially addressed in this review. In order that the scope of applications can be broadened, the understanding of the glass-forming criteria is important for the design of new alloy systems and also the processing techniques.},

  abstract = {Dynamic relaxation is an intrinsic and universal feature of glasses and enables fluctuation and dissipation to occur, which induces plentiful behaviour, maintains equilibrium, and achieves evolution in glass systems. Relaxation covers a broad time, frequency, and temperature ranges and determines the functions, behaviour, properties and applications of glassy system. Investigations of dynamic relaxation are significant for understanding the nature of glasses, liquids, and the critical issues of glass formation and transition, dynamic and structural heterogeneities, flow behaviour and flow units, various crossover temperatures, deformations, aging and rejuvenation, stability, crystallization, and the mechanical and physical properties of glasses. Metallic glasses (MGs) with unique microstructure and mechanical and functional properties, offer a simple but effective system for study of relaxation and related issues in glass science. In this review, a panoramic view of the state of the art of various aspects of dynamic relaxation in metallic glassy system, as well as a comparison with other glassy systems, is presented. The features and mechanisms of each known relaxation mode including primary {$\alpha$}-relaxation, slow and fast 7 {$\beta$}-relaxations, nearly constant loss, and boson peak, as well as their coupling in MGs, are reviewed and summarized. Emphasis is presented to the microstructural origin of these dynamic relaxation modes and their connection with the dynamic and structural heterogeneities in MGs. The factors which determine and affect the relaxation modes and behaviour in low-dimensional MGs are also introduced. It is shown that the relaxation in MGs is connected with their structural characteristics, heterogeneity, formation, glass transition, flow behaviour, physical and mechanical properties, crystallization, stability, and the localized atomic diffusion. The roles and the importance of dynamic relaxation in understanding many crucial issues in glassy physics are demonstrated. The correlations between dynamic relaxation and various properties of MGs are established and summarized. With this review on dynamic relaxation in metallic glasses, relaxation in MG can provide an effective perspective for understanding nearly all issues in metallic glasses. It is demonstrated that the relationship of relaxation to various properties, similar to the relationship of structure\textendash{}property of crystalline materials, can be applied to control and design of new glassy materials with multiple functionalities, superior mechanical performance, and other extraordinary physical and chemical properties. Finally, the key unsolved questions regarding dynamic relaxation in metallic glasses are listed, and several emerging research directions in this still-evolving field are highlighted for future investigations.},

In a preliminary study, we experimentally demonstrate that Jupyter notebooks are inundated with poor quality code, e.g., not respecting recommended coding practices, or containing unused variables and deprecated functions. Considering the education nature of Jupyter notebooks, these poor coding practices as well as the lacks of quality control might be propagated into the next generation of developers. Hence, we argue that there is a strong need to programmatically analyze Jupyter notebooks, calling on our community to pay more attention to the reliability of Jupyter notebooks.},

The computations were executed using the gain-loss (Becker\textendash{}Doring) equations that form the framework of Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT). The growth rates were obtained in several different ways, using various choices for the kinetic model, the generalized diffusion coefficient, and the physical input data.

The Stokes shift for naphthalene ({$\approx$}63 cm-1) turns out to be independent of the solvent polarity over a wide range of the static dielectric constants. Its time dependence is governed by the structural (or {$\alpha$}- or shear stress) relaxation time of n-propanol, without any signature of the strong dielectric relaxation. For this solvent, structural and dipolar contributions can be distinguished because the time scale for dipole reorientation is a factor of 25 slower than the {$\alpha$}-relaxation time. We conclude that the solvation of naphthalene reflects excitation-induced changes in the van der Waals interactions, which makes it an ideal probe for assessing shear stress or mechanical relaxations on microscopic spatial scales near Tg.},

This has remained a formidable task, despite a plethora of existing clustering methods. We present InfleCS, a novel method for extracting well-defined core states from free energy landscapes. The method is based on a Gaussian mixture free energy estimator and exploits the shape of the estimated density landscape. The core states that naturally arise from the clustering allow for detailed characterization of the conformational ensemble. The clustering quality is evaluated on three toy models with different properties, where the method is shown to consistently outperform other conventional and state-of-the-art clustering methods. Finally, the method is applied to a temperature enhanced molecular dynamics simulation of Ca2+-bound Calmodulin. Through the free energy landscape, we discover a pathway between a canonical and a compact state, revealing conformational changes driven by electrostatic interactions.},

From the liquid perspective, the puzzle is to understand stress relaxation in the disordered state. From the perspective of solids, the challenge is to extend our description of structure and its mechanical consequences to materials without long range order. Using computer simulations, we show that the localized low frequency normal modes of a configuration in a supercooled liquid are causally correlated to the irreversible structural reorganization of the particles within that configuration. We also demonstrate that the spatial distribution of these soft local modes can persist in spite of significant particle reorganization. The consequence of these two results is that it is now feasible to construct a theory of relaxation length scales in glass-forming liquids without recourse to dynamics and to explicitly relate molecular properties to their collective relaxation.},

We use systems of up to 102 400 particles to capture the decay of the correlation functions associated with translational order (TO) as well as the bond-orientational (BO) order. We study the role of dislocations and disclinations and their distribution functions. We computed the temperature dependence of the second moment of the TO parameter ({$\Psi$}G) as well as of the order parameter {$\Psi$}6 associated with BO order. By applying finite-size scaling of these second moments, we determined the anomalous dimension critical exponents {$\eta$}(T) and {$\eta$}6(T) associated with power-law decay of the {$\Psi$}G and {$\Psi$}6 correlation functions. We also computed the temperature-dependent distribution of the order parameters {$\Psi$}G and {$\Psi$}6 on the complex plane that supports a two-stage melting with a hexatic phase as an intermediate phase. From the correlation functions of {$\Psi$}G and {$\Psi$}6, we extracted the corresponding temperature-dependent correlation lengths {$\xi$}(T) and {$\xi$}6(T). The analysis of our results leads to a consistent picture strongly supporting a two-stage melting scenario as predicted by the Kosterlitz, Thouless, Halperin, Nelson, and Young (KTHNY) theory where melting occurs via two continuous phase transitions, first from solid to a hexatic fluid at temperature Tm, and then from the hexatic fluid to an isotropic fluid at a critical temperature Ti. We find that {$\xi$}(T) and {$\xi$}6(T) have a distinctly different temperature dependence, each diverging at different temperature, and that their finite-size scaling properties are consistent with the KTHNY theory. We also used the temperature dependence of {$\eta$} and {$\eta$}6 and their theoretical bounds to provide estimates for the critical temperatures Tm and Ti, which can also be estimated using the Binder ratio. Our results are within error bars, the same as those extracted from the divergence of the correlation lengths.},

Experimental 1H and/or 13C NMR spectral data and its proper interpretation for the compound of interest is required as a starting point. The approach involves the following steps: (i) using molecular mechanics calculations (with, e.g., MacroModel) to generate a library of conformers; (ii) using density functional theory (DFT) calculations (with, e.g., Gaussian 09) to determine optimal geometry, free energies and chemical shifts for each conformer; (iii) determining Boltzmann-weighted proton and carbon chemical shifts; and (iv) comparing the computed chemical shifts for two or more candidate structures with experimental data to determine the best fit. For a typical structure assignment of a small organic molecule (e.g., fewer than {$\sim$}10 non-H atoms or up to {$\sim$}180 a.m.u. and {$\sim$}20 conformers), this protocol can be completed in {$\sim$}2 h of active effort over a 2-d period; for more complex molecules (e.g., fewer than {$\sim$}30 non-H atoms or up to {$\sim$}500 a.m.u. and {$\sim$}50 conformers), the protocol requires {$\sim$}3\textendash{}6 h of active effort over a 2-week period.

In order to perform these measurements, a new semi-empirical potential for Ni\textendash{}Zr alloy was developed that well reproduces the material properties required to model SLIs in the Ni50.0Zr50.0 alloy. In particular, the developed potential is shown to provide that the solid phase emerging from the liquid Ni50.0Zr50.0 alloy is B33 (apart from a small fraction of point defects), in agreement with the experimental phase diagram. The SLI properties obtained using the developed potential exhibit an extraordinary degree of anisotropy. It is observed that anisotropies in both the interfacial free energy and mobility are an order of magnitude larger than those measured to date in any other metallic compound. Moreover, the [0 1 0] interface is shown to play a significant role in the observed anisotropy. Our data suggest that the [0 1 0] interface simultaneously corresponds to the lowest mobility, the lowest free energy and the highest stiffness of all inclinations in B33 Ni\textendash{}Zr. This finding can be understood by taking into account a rather complicated crystal structure in this crystallographic direction.},

  abstract = {Author summary Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

We report on a study of references to Jupyter notebooks in astronomy over a 5-year period (2014-2018). References increased rapidly, but fewer than half of the references led to Jupyter notebooks that could be located and opened. Jupyter notebooks appear better suited to supporting the research process than to providing access to research objects. We recommend that authors cite individual data and software objects, and that they stabilize any notebooks cited in publications. Publishers should increase the number of citations allowed in papers and employ descriptive metadata-rich citation styles that facilitate credit and discovery.},

  abstract = {The concept underlying precision medicine is that prevention, diagnosis and treatment of pathologies such as cancer can be improved through an understanding of the influence of individual patient characteristics. Predictive medicine seeks to derive this understanding through mechanistic models of the causes and (potential) progression of diseases within a given individual. This represents a grand challenge for computational biomedicine as it requires the integration of highly varied (and potentially vast) quantitative experimental datasets into models of complex biological systems. It is becoming increasingly clear that this challenge can only be answered through the use of complex workflows that combine diverse analyses and whose design is informed by an understanding of how predictions must be accompanied by estimates of uncertainty. Each stage in such a workflow can, in general, have very different computational requirements. If funding bodies and the HPC community are serious about the desire to support such approaches, they must consider the need for portable, persistent and stable tools designed to promote extensive long term development and testing of these workflows. From the perspective of model developers (and with even greater relevance to potential clinical or experimental collaborators) the enormous diversity of interfaces and supercomputer policies, frequently designed with monolithic applications in mind, can represent a serious barrier to innovation. Here we use experiences from work on two very different biomedical modeling scenarios - brain bloodflow and small molecule drug selection - to highlight issues with the current programming and execution environments and suggest potential solutions.},

Based on molecular dynamics simulations, here we find medium-range atomic packing orders in metallic glasses, which are hidden in the diffraction data in terms of structure factors or pair correlation functions. The analysis of the hidden orders in various metallic glasses indicates that the glassy and crystalline solids share a nontrivial structural homology in short-to-medium range, and the hidden orders are formulated by inheriting partial crystalline orders during glass formation. As the number of chemical components increases, more hidden orders are often developed in a metallic glass and entangled topologically. We use this phenomenon to explain the geometric frustration in glass formation and the glass-forming ability of metallic alloys.},

They are already used in rewriteable optical data storage and offer great potential as an emerging non-volatile electronic memory. This review looks at the unique property combination that characterizes phase-change materials. The crystalline state often shows an octahedral-like atomic arrangement, frequently accompanied by pronounced lattice distortions and huge vacancy concentrations. This can be attributed to the chemical bonding in phase-change alloys, which is promoted by p-orbitals. From this insight, phase-change alloys with desired properties can be designed. This is demonstrated for the optical properties of phase-change alloys, in particular the contrast between the amorphous and crystalline states. The origin of the fast crystallization kinetics is also discussed.},

The observed dependence of the incubation time on the degree of undercooling is consistent with a first-order phase transition. Simulation results indicate that such transition is accompanied by the change of bond-orientational order without noticeable change in density. The temperature dependence of atomic diffusion revealed by simulations is also in agreement with experiments. These observations indicate the need of two-order parameters in describing phase transitions of liquids.},

  abstract = {Water is ubiquitous, but its physical properties are anomalous compared with most liquids. Because the anomalies become enhanced upon cooling, understanding the behavior of deeply supercooled water is critical. Unfortunately, experiments below {$\sim$}236 K at ambient pressure are difficult due to uncontrolled crystallization. Using a pulsed-laser\textendash{}heating technique, we have determined the crystalline-ice growth rate and liquid-water diffusivity for temperatures between 180 and 262 K in ultrahigh-vacuum conditions. The fact that both of these quantities are smoothly varying rules out the hypothesis that water's properties have a singularity at or near 228 K. However, the results are consistent with a previous prediction for the diffusivity that assumed no thermodynamic transitions occur in the supercooled region., Understanding deeply supercooled water is key to unraveling many of water's anomalous properties. However, developing this understanding has proven difficult due to rapid and uncontrolled crystallization. Using a pulsed-laser\textendash{}heating technique, we measure the growth rate of crystalline ice, G(T), for 180 K {$<$} T {$<$} 262 K, that is, deep within water's ``no man's land'' in ultrahigh-vacuum conditions. Isothermal measurements of G(T) are also made for 126 K {$\leq$} T {$\leq$} 151 K. The self-diffusion of supercooled liquid water, D(T), is obtained from G(T) using the Wilson\textendash{}Frenkel model of crystal growth. For T {$>$} 237 K and P {$\sim$} 10-8 Pa, G(T) and D(T) have super-Arrhenius (``fragile'') temperature dependences, but both cross over to Arrhenius (``strong'') behavior with a large activation energy in no man's land.

  abstract = {Tetrahydrofuran (THF) clathrate hydrate has been frequently used in experimental studies instead of gas hydrates because it forms at a temperature higher than the ice point under ambient pressure. In this paper, we compare the crystal growth rates of THF hydrate and ice using molecular dynamics simulations. It is demonstrated that the crystal growth of THF hydrate is much slower than that of ice. The growth rates of THF hydrate significantly deviate from a standard kinetic model known as the Wilson\textendash{}Frenkel model, whereas it reproduces the temperature dependence of the growth rate of ice. The slow crystal growth and the deviation from the Wilson\textendash{}Frenkel model are attributed to the trapping of THF molecules in open small cages at the hydrate surface. We calculate the free energy profile of a THF molecule transferring from the bulk solution phase to the hydrate surface using the umbrella sampling technique. It is shown that a THF molecule trapped in an open small cage needs to cross one or two free energy barriers to escape from the surface region. We also refer to the similarity between the mechanism of slow growth of THF hydrate and the effect of kinetic hydrate inhibitors.},

The system features on-chip particle data storage and management, short- and long-range force evaluation, as well as bonded forces, motion update, and particle migration. Other contributions of this work include exploring numerous architectural trade-offs and analysis on various mappings schemes among particles/cells and the various on-chip compute units.
