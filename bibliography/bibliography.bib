  abstract = {In spite of the great research effort made in Grid technology in the last years, application development and execution in the Grid continue requiring a high level of expertise due to its complex and dynamic nature. The Distributed Resource Management Application API (DRMAA) has been proposed to aid the rapid development and distribution of applications across the Grid. In this paper we present the first implementation of the DRMAA standard on a Globus-based testbed, and show its suitability to express typical scientific applications. The DRMAA routines have been implemented using the functionality provided by the GridWay framework.},

  abstract = {Many courses in scientific fields require students not just to write code, but to also visualize their data, work through a mathematical derivation, or write a paragraph interpreting their results. The Jupyter notebook (formerly known as the IPython notebook) is an ideal platform for creating assignments that include all of these question types, due to its interactive document format that weaves together code, prose, images, and math. Instructors can provide students with self-contained notebooks that include instructions, coding exercises, and written responses all in the same place. Students can write and execute code in these notebooks, and any text or images produced by the code are displayed immediately beneath the input that produced them. However, while having all exercises in the same place makes for better assignments, it also makes them difficult to grade. This demo presents nbgrader, an open-source tool developed by the Jupyter project that solves this problem by providing an interface that blends the autograding of notebook-based assignments with manual human grading. Additionally, nbgrader streamlines the process of assignment creation, distribution, collection, grading, and feedback-a process that is often logistically difficult for instructors. To give students access to the notebook, this demo illustrates how it can be deployed in the cloud, and how this complements the grading process. Information about the Jupyter notebook can be found at http://jupyter.org/, and a demo of the notebook at https://try.jupyter.org/. Information about nbgrader can be found at https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader. A laptop is recommended for this demo. Handouts will be provided.},

addition to interactive exploration. The new architecture also allows
users to work in any language, with implementations in Python, R, Julia,
Haskell, and several other languages. The language agnostic parts of
IPython have been renamed to Jupyter, to better capture the notion that
a cross-language design can encapsulate commonalities present in
computational research regardless of the programming language being
used. This architecture offers components like the web-based Notebook
interface, that supports rich documents that combine code and
computational results with text narratives, mathematics, images, video
and any media that a modern browser can display. This interface can be
used not only in research, but also for publication and education, as
notebooks can be converted to a variety of output formats, including
HTML and PDF. Recent developments in the Jupyter project include a
multi-user environment for hosting notebooks for a class or research
group, a live collaboration notebook via Google Docs, and better support
for languages other than Python.},

To improve the scientific productivity of users, NERSC provides a large number of pre-compiled applications on the Cray XE6 machine, Hopper. Depending on the compiler, compiler flags and libraries used to build the codes, applications can have large differences in performance. In this paper, we compare the performance differences arising from the use of different compilers, compiler optimization flags and libraries available on Hopper over a set of materials science and chemistry applications that are widely used at NERSC. The selected applications are written in Fortran, C, C++, or a combination of these languages, and use MPI or other massage passing libraries as well as linear algebra, FFT, and global array libraries. The compilers explored are the PGI, GNU, Cray, and Intel compilers. It should be emphasized that the compiler optimizations ultimately adopted for production builds are optimizations where the resulting binaries pass strict validity checks and can be used for scientific calculations. These builds do not necessarily represent the highest optimizations the compilers can reach.},

We selected LAMMPS, popular simulation software used in material science, for this study. Both descriptive metadata elements and the types of reuse are examined from a sample of 400 research papers. The results indicate that both descriptive metadata elements and reuse types about LAMMPS are presented in incomplete and inconsistent ways, and this interferes with the values of scientific software, as a type of research data.

To capture and persist the provenance and performance data of these workflows, we have designed and developed the Chimbuko and ProvEn frameworks. Chimbuko captures provenance and enables detailed single workflow performance analysis. ProvEn is a hybrid, queryable system for storing and analyzing the provenance and performance metrics of multiple runs in workflow performance analysis campaigns. Workflow provenance and performance data output from Chimbuko can be visualized in a dynamic, multilevel visualization providing overview and zoom-in capabilities for areas of interest. Provenance and related performance data ingested into ProvEn is queryable and can be used to reproduce runs. Our provenance-based approach highlights challenges in extracting information and gaps in the information collected. It is agnostic to the type of provenance data it captures so that both the reproducibility of scientific results and that of performance can be explored with our tools.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Approaches for computing small molecule binding free energies based on molecular simulations are now regularly being employed by academic and industry practitioners to study receptor-ligand systems and prioritize the synthesis of small molecules for ligand design. Given the variety of methods and implementations available, it is natural to ask how the convergence rates and final predictions of these methods compare. In this study, we describe the concept and results for the SAMPL6 SAMPLing challenge, the first challenge from the SAMPL series focusing on the assessment of convergence properties and reproducibility of binding free energy methodologies. We provided parameter files, partial charges, and multiple initial geometries for two octa-acid (OA) and one cucurbit[8]uril (CB8) host-guest systems. Participants submitted binding free energy predictions as a function of the number of force and energy evaluations for seven different alchemical and physical-pathway (i.e., potential of mean force and weighted ensemble of trajectories) methodologies implemented with the GROMACS, AMBER, NAMD, or OpenMM simulation engines. To rank the methods, we developed an efficiency statistic based on bias and variance of the free energy estimates. For the two small OA binders, the free energy estimates computed with alchemical and potential of mean force approaches show relatively similar variance and bias as a function of the number of energy/force evaluations, with the attach-pull-release (APR), GROMACS expanded ensemble, and NAMD double decoupling submissions obtaining the greatest efficiency. The differences between the methods increase when analyzing the CB8-quinine system, where both the guest size and correlation times for system dynamics are greater. For this system, nonequilibrium switching (GROMACS/NS-DS/SB) obtained the overall highest efficiency. Surprisingly, the results suggest that specifying force field parameters and partial charges is insufficient to generally ensure reproducibility, and we observe differences between seemingly converged predictions ranging approximately from 0.3 to 1.0 kcal/mol, even with almost identical simulations parameters and system setup (e.g., Lennard-Jones cutoff, ionic composition). Further work will be required to completely identify the exact source of these discrepancies. Among the conclusions emerging from the data, we found that Hamiltonian replica exchange - while displaying very small variance - can be affected by a slowly-decaying bias that depends on the initial population of the replicas, that bidirectional estimators are significantly more efficient than unidirectional estimators for nonequilibrium free energy calculations for systems considered, and that the Berendsen barostat introduces non-negligible artifacts in expanded ensemble simulations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {I look to the left… NOTHING?I look to the right… NOTHING?So, I say to myself: There is SOMETHING here…~One of mankind’s successful attempts to find out what that SOMETHING is the Monte Carlo Method.~The method, as well as many of the achievements of mankind, was created for military purposes as part of the scientific tasks associated with the creation of the atomic bomb. The event was super secret and everything was encrypted. The code name of the method – Monte Carlo, has proved to be very successful and has survived in civilization (suck fate has the name of the armoured fighting vehicle – tank).~The task was to create a method for modeling the behavior of a complex probability system. The classic solution is to present the phenomenon with one, two, etc. (but always a limited number) indicators. The new solution is the opposite – \&quot;artificially\&quot; increasing the number of input/output information.~Currently, the Monte Carlo Method is effective, and in some cases – the only one, solution for a wide range of tasks from all areas of scientific knowledge. That is why we’ve decided to present yet another exposure of the foundations and some of the Monte Carlo applications.~The monograph is divided in two parts.~The first part returns the reader during the World War II. We follow the development of the idea of the method and the associated need for creating a powerful enough computer. The first publications are mentioned and are examined the scientific basics of the method and some basic algorithms.~The second part contains applications of Monte Carlo method for solving tasks that can be characterized as \&quot;engineering\&quot;. Without neglecting the concrete results obtained, we will point out that the described approaches for the practical application of the Monte Carlo method are of the greatest interest.},

  abstract = {This article describes the motivation, design, and progress of the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS). JOSS is a free and open-access journal that publishes articles describing research software. It has the dual goals of improving the quality of the software submitted and providing a mechanism for research software developers to receive credit. While designed to work within the current merit system of science, JOSS addresses the dearth of rewards for key contributions to science made in the form of software. JOSS publishes articles that encapsulate scholarship contained in the software itself, and its rigorous peer review targets the software components: functionality, documentation, tests, continuous integration, and the license. A JOSS article contains an abstract describing the purpose and functionality of the software, references, and a link to the software archive. The article is the entry point of a JOSS submission, which encompasses the full set of software artifacts. Submission and review proceed in the open, on GitHub. Editors, reviewers, and authors work collaboratively and openly. Unlike other journals, JOSS does not reject articles requiring major revision; while not yet accepted, articles remain visible and under review until the authors make adequate changes (or withdraw, if unable to meet requirements). Once an article is accepted, JOSS gives it a DOI, deposits its metadata in Crossref, and the article can begin collecting citations on indexers like Google Scholar and other services. Authors retain copyright of their JOSS article, releasing it under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. In its first year, starting in May 2016, JOSS published 111 articles, with more than 40 additional articles under review. JOSS is a sponsored project of the nonprofit organization NumFOCUS and is an affiliate of the Open Source Initiative.},

In the best case, authors may provide their source code as a compressed archive and they may feel confident their research is reproducible. But this is not exactly true. James Buckheit and David Donoho proposed more than two decades ago that an article about computational results is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code, and data that produced the result. This implies new workflows, in particular in peer-reviews. Existing journals have been slow to adapt: source codes are rarely requested and are hardly ever actually executed to check that they produce the results advertised in the article. ReScience is a peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research and encourages the explicit replication of already published research, promoting new and open-source implementations in order to ensure that the original research can be replicated from its description. To achieve this goal, the whole publishing chain is radically different from other traditional scientific journals. ReScience resides on GitHub where each new implementation of a computational study is made available together with comments, explanations, and software tests.},

That is, we suggest that a paper that involves a computer program not be accepted for publication unless the source code becomes publicly available. The adoption of such a policy by editors, editorial boards, and reviewers will improve the ability to replicate scientific results, and will also make computational astronomy methods more available to other researchers who wish to apply them to their data.},

As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

  abstract = {The scientific community across all disciplines faces the same challenges of ensuring accessibility, reproducibility, and efficient comparability of scientific results. Computational neuroscience is a rapidly developing field, where reproducibility and comparability of research results have gained increasing interest over the past years. As the number of computational models of brain functions is increasing, we chose to address reproducibility using four previously published computational models of astrocyte excitability as an example. Although not conventionally taken into account when modeling neuronal systems, astrocytes have been shown to take part in a variety of in vitro and in vivo phenomena including synaptic transmission. Two of the selected astrocyte models describe spontaneous calcium excitability, and the other two neurotransmitter-evoked calcium excitability. We specifically addressed how well the original simulation results can be reproduced with a reimplementation of the models. Additionally, we studied how well the selected models can be reused and whether they are comparable in other stimulation conditions and research settings. Unexpectedly, we found out that three of the model publications did not give all the necessary information required to reimplement the models. In addition, we were able to reproduce the original results of only one of the models completely based on the information given in the original publications and in the errata. We actually found errors in the equations provided by two of the model publications; after modifying the equations accordingly, the original results were reproduced more accurately. Even though the selected models were developed to describe the same biological event, namely astrocyte calcium excitability, the models behaved quite differently compared to one another. Our findings on a specific set of published astrocyte models stress the importance of proper validation of the models against experimental wet-lab data from astrocytes as well as the careful review process of models. A variety of aspects of model development could be improved, including the presentation of models in publications and databases. Specifically, all necessary mathematical equations, as well as parameter values, initial values of variables, and stimuli used should be given precisely for successful reproduction of scientific results.},

In lipid membranes research, particle-based molecular simulations are a powerful tool alongside continuum theory, lipidomics, and model, in vitro, and in vivo experiments. Molecular simulations can provide precise and reproducible spatiotemporal (atomic- and femtosecond-level) information about membrane structure, mechanics, thermodynamics, kinetics, and dynamics. Yet the simulation of lipid membranes can be a daunting task, given the uniqueness of lipid membranes relative to conventional liquid-liquid and solid-liquid interfaces, the immense and complex thermodynamic and statistical mechanical theory, the diversity of multiscale lipid models, limitations of modern computing power, the difficulty and ambiguity of simulation controls, finite size effects, competitive continuum simulation alternatives, and the desired application, including vesicle experiments and biological membranes. These issues can complicate an essential understanding of the field of lipid membranes, and create major bottlenecks to simulation advancement. In this article, we clarify these issues and present a consistent, thorough, and user-friendly framework for the design of state-of-the-art lipid membrane MD simulations. We hope to allow early-career researchers to quickly overcome common obstacles in the field of lipid membranes and reach maximal impact in their simulations.},

  abstract = {The ability to predict transport properties (e.g., diffusivity, viscosity, and conductivity) is one of the primary benefits of molecular simulation. Although most studies focus on the accuracy of the simulation output compared to experimental data, such a comparison primarily tests the adequacy of the force field (i.e. the model). By contrast, the reliability of different simulation methodologies for predicting transport properties is the focus of this manuscript. Unfortunately, obtaining reproducible estimates of transport properties from molecular simulation is not as straightforward as static properties. Therefore, this manuscript discusses the best practices that should be followed to ensure that the simulation output is reliable, i.e. is a valid representation of the force field implemented. We also discuss procedures to use so that the results are reproducible (i.e. can be obtained by other researchers following the same methods and procedures). There are two classes by which transport properties are predicted: equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD). This manuscript presents the best practices for EMD, leaving NEMD for a future publication. As self-diffusivity and shear viscosity are the most prevalent transport properties found in the literature, the discussion will also be limited to these properties with the expectation that future publications will discuss best practices for thermal conductivity, ionic conductivity, and multicomponent diffusivity.},

  abstract = {The efficacy of drug treatments depends on how tightly small molecules bind to their target proteins. The rapid and accurate quantification of the strength of these interactions (as measured by binding affinity) is a grand challenge of computational chemistry, surmounting which could revolutionize drug design and provide the platform for patient-specific medicine. Recent evidence suggests that molecular dynamics (MD) can achieve useful predictive accuracy ({$<$} 1 kcal/mol). For this predictive accuracy to impact clinical decision making, binding free energy computational campaigns must provide results rapidly and without loss of accuracy. This demands advances in algorithms, scalable software systems, and efficient utilization of supercomputing resources. We introduce a framework called HTBAC, designed to support accurate and scalable drug binding affinity calculations, while marshaling large simulation campaigns. We show that HTBAC supports the specification and execution of free-energy protocols at scale. This paper makes three main contributions: (1) shows the importance of adaptive execution for ensemble-based free energy protocols to improve binding affinity accuracy; (2) presents and characterizes HTBAC -- a software system that enables the scalable and adaptive execution of binding affinity protocols at scale; and (3) for a widely used free-energy protocol (TIES), shows improvements in the accuracy of simulations for a fixed amount of resource, or reduced resource consumption for a fixed accuracy as a consequence of adaptive execution.},

By connecting many computing clusters together, QosCosGrid offers easy-to-use mapping, execution and monitoring capabilities for a variety of complex computations, such as parameter sweep, workflows, MPI or hybrid MPI-OpenMP as well as multiscale simulations. Thanks to QosCosGrid, large-scale programming models written in Fortran, C, C++ or Java can be automatically distributed over a network of computing resources with guaranteed Quality of Service – for example guaranteed startup time of a job. Consequently, applications can be run at specified periods with reduced execution time and waiting times. This enables more complex problem instances to be addressed. In order to prove the usefulness of the new functionality of QosCosGrid a detailed description of the system along with a real use case scenario from the quantum chemistry science domain will be presented in this chapter.},

In many cases, resistance can be linked to genetic changes in target proteins, either pre-existing or evolutionarily selected during treatment. Key to overcoming this challenge is an understanding of the molecular determinants of drug binding. Using multi-stage pipelines of molecular simulations we can gain insights into the binding free energy and the residence time of a ligand, which can inform both stratified and personal treatment regimes and drug development. To support the scalable, adaptive and automated calculation of the binding free energy on high-performance computing resources, we introduce the High-throughput Binding Affinity Calculator (HTBAC). HTBAC uses a building block approach in order to attain both workflow flexibility and performance.},

  abstract = {The concept underlying precision medicine is that prevention, diagnosis and treatment of pathologies such as cancer can be improved through an understanding of the influence of individual patient characteristics. Predictive medicine seeks to derive this understanding through mechanistic models of the causes and (potential) progression of diseases within a given individual. This represents a grand challenge for computational biomedicine as it requires the integration of highly varied (and potentially vast) quantitative experimental datasets into models of complex biological systems. It is becoming increasingly clear that this challenge can only be answered through the use of complex workflows that combine diverse analyses and whose design is informed by an understanding of how predictions must be accompanied by estimates of uncertainty. Each stage in such a workflow can, in general, have very different computational requirements. If funding bodies and the HPC community are serious about the desire to support such approaches, they must consider the need for portable, persistent and stable tools designed to promote extensive long term development and testing of these workflows. From the perspective of model developers (and with even greater relevance to potential clinical or experimental collaborators) the enormous diversity of interfaces and supercomputer policies, frequently designed with monolithic applications in mind, can represent a serious barrier to innovation. Here we use experiences from work on two very different biomedical modeling scenarios - brain bloodflow and small molecule drug selection - to highlight issues with the current programming and execution environments and suggest potential solutions.},

Release 4.6 of GROMACS uses SIMD acceleration on a wide range of architectures, GPU offloading acceleration, and both OpenMP and MPI parallelism within and between nodes, respectively. The recent work on acceleration made it necessary to revisit the fundamental algorithms of molecular simulation, including the concept of neighborsearching, and we discuss the present and future challenges we see for exascale simulation - in particular a very fine-grained task parallelism. We also discuss the software management, code peer review and continuous integration testing required for a project of this complexity.},

This paradigm has been slower to infiltrate the catalysis community due to larger configuration spaces, difficulty in describing necessary calculations, and thermodynamic/kinetic quantities that require many interdependent calculations. We present our own informatics tool that uses dynamic dependency graphs to share, organize, and schedule calculations to enable new, flexible research workflows in surface science. This approach is illustrated for the large-scale screening of intermetallic surfaces for electrochemical catalyst activity. Similar approaches will be important to bring the benefits of informatics and data science to surface science research.

  abstract = {A modern biomedical research project can easily contain hundreds of analysis steps and lack of reproducibility of the analyses has been recognized as a severe issue. While thorough documentation enables reproducibility, the number of analysis programs used can be so large that in reality reproducibility cannot be easily achieved. Literate programming is an approach to present computer programs to human readers. The code is rearranged to follow the logic of the program, and to explain that logic in a natural language. The code executed by the computer is extracted from the literate source code. As such, literate programming is an ideal formalism for systematizing analysis steps in biomedical research. We have developed the reproducible computing tool Lir (literate, reproducible computing) that allows a tool-agnostic approach to biomedical data analysis. We demonstrate the utility of Lir by applying it to a case study. Our aim was to investigate the role of endosomal trafficking regulators to the progression of breast cancer. In this analysis, a variety of tools were combined to interpret the available data: a relational database, standard command-line tools, and a statistical computing environment. The analysis revealed that the lipid transport related genes LAPTM4B and NDRG1 are coamplified in breast cancer patients, and identified genes potentially cooperating with LAPTM4B in breast cancer progression. Our case study demonstrates that with Lir, an array of tools can be combined in the same data analysis to improve efficiency, reproducibility, and ease of understanding.

  abstract = {Some liquids, if cooled rapidly enough to avoid crystallization, can be frozen into a nonergodic glassy state. The tendency for a material to form a glass when quenched is called “glass-forming ability,” and it is of key significance both fundamentally and for materials science applications. Here, we consider liquids with competing orderings, where an increase in the glass-forming ability is signaled by a depression of the melting temperature towards its minimum at triple or eutectic points. With simulations of two model systems where glass-forming ability can be tuned by an external parameter, we are able to interpolate between crystal-forming and glass-forming behavior. We find that the enhancement of the glass-forming ability is caused by an increase in the structural difference between liquid and crystal: stronger competition in orderings towards the melting point minimum makes a liquid structure more disordered (more complex). This increase in the liquid-crystal structure difference can be described by a single adimensional parameter, i.e., the interface energy cost scaled by the thermal energy, which we call the “thermodynamic interface penalty.” Our finding may provide a general physical principle for not only controlling the glass-forming ability but also the emergence of glassy behavior of various systems with competing orderings, including orderings of structural, magnetic, electronic, charge, and dipolar origin.},

We applied this method to the pure Ni case for a moderate undercooling where no nucleation can be observed in the conventional MD simulation, and obtained nucleation rate in good agreement with the experimental data. Moreover, the method is applied to simulate an even more sluggish event: the nucleation of the B2 phase in a strong glass-forming Cu-Zr alloy. The nucleation rate was found to be 8 orders of magnitude smaller than Ni at the same undercooling, which well explains the good glass formability of the alloy. Thus, our work opens a new avenue to study solidification under realistic experimental conditions via atomistic computer simulation.},

  abstract = {Tetrahydrofuran (THF) clathrate hydrate has been frequently used in experimental studies instead of gas hydrates because it forms at a temperature higher than the ice point under ambient pressure. In this paper, we compare the crystal growth rates of THF hydrate and ice using molecular dynamics simulations. It is demonstrated that the crystal growth of THF hydrate is much slower than that of ice. The growth rates of THF hydrate significantly deviate from a standard kinetic model known as the Wilson–Frenkel model, whereas it reproduces the temperature dependence of the growth rate of ice. The slow crystal growth and the deviation from the Wilson–Frenkel model are attributed to the trapping of THF molecules in open small cages at the hydrate surface. We calculate the free energy profile of a THF molecule transferring from the bulk solution phase to the hydrate surface using the umbrella sampling technique. It is shown that a THF molecule trapped in an open small cage needs to cross one or two free energy barriers to escape from the surface region. We also refer to the similarity between the mechanism of slow growth of THF hydrate and the effect of kinetic hydrate inhibitors.},

While GC growth is known for 12 systems, its features vary greatly with growth rates spanning a factor of 104. We report that the general condition for GC growth to exist is that liquid diffusion be slow relative to crystal growth according to D/u {$<$} 7 pm. This condition holds for all liquids exhibiting GC growth and suggests that the phenomenon is a solid-state process terminated by fluidity. GC growth must solidify several molecular layers before rearrangement by diffusion. We propose that GC growth propagates by a nonequilibrium crystal/liquid interface 3 nm wide that solidifies by local mobility. These results explain the prevalence of GC growth among organic liquids and guide its discovery in other materials.},

Here we consider whether such suppression of crystallization has a kinetic or thermodynamic nature and investigate its mechanism. We introduce a model in which the degree of fivefold symmetry can be tuned by favouring arrangements of particles in pentagonal bipyramids. We thus show that fivefold symmetry has both kinetic and thermodynamic effects on the mechanism of crystallization to a face-centred cubic crystal. Our results suggest that the mechanism of crystallization suppression is related to the surface tension between fluid and crystal. Interestingly, the degree of fivefold symmetry has little effect on crystal growth rate, suggesting that growth may be only weakly coupled to fluid structure in hard sphere like systems. Upon increasing the fivefold symmetry, we find a first-order transition to an alternative icosahedra-rich phase. At intermediate bias strengths we find a one-component glassformer.},

  abstract = {Solid–liquid interface (SLI) properties of the Ni–Zr B33 phase were determined from molecular dynamics simulations. In order to perform these measurements, a new semi-empirical potential for Ni–Zr alloy was developed that well reproduces the material properties required to model SLIs in the Ni50.0Zr50.0 alloy. In particular, the developed potential is shown to provide that the solid phase emerging from the liquid Ni50.0Zr50.0 alloy is B33 (apart from a small fraction of point defects), in agreement with the experimental phase diagram. The SLI properties obtained using the developed potential exhibit an extraordinary degree of anisotropy. It is observed that anisotropies in both the interfacial free energy and mobility are an order of magnitude larger than those measured to date in any other metallic compound. Moreover, the [0 1 0] interface is shown to play a significant role in the observed anisotropy. Our data suggest that the [0 1 0] interface simultaneously corresponds to the lowest mobility, the lowest free energy and the highest stiffness of all inclinations in B33 Ni–Zr. This finding can be understood by taking into account a rather complicated crystal structure in this crystallographic direction.},

Here we report experimental evidences of a liquid–liquid transition in glass-forming La50Al35Ni15 melt above its liquidus temperature by 27Al nuclear magnetic resonance including the temperature dependence of cage volume fluctuations and atomic diffusion. The observed dependence of the incubation time on the degree of undercooling is consistent with a first-order phase transition. Simulation results indicate that such transition is accompanied by the change of bond-orientational order without noticeable change in density. The temperature dependence of atomic diffusion revealed by simulations is also in agreement with experiments. These observations indicate the need of two-order parameters in describing phase transitions of liquids.},

Based on molecular dynamics simulations, here we find medium-range atomic packing orders in metallic glasses, which are hidden in the diffraction data in terms of structure factors or pair correlation functions. The analysis of the hidden orders in various metallic glasses indicates that the glassy and crystalline solids share a nontrivial structural homology in short-to-medium range, and the hidden orders are formulated by inheriting partial crystalline orders during glass formation. As the number of chemical components increases, more hidden orders are often developed in a metallic glass and entangled topologically. We use this phenomenon to explain the geometric frustration in glass formation and the glass-forming ability of metallic alloys.},

In this case, a theoretical analysis of dendritic solidification is given for congruently melting alloys in which chemical segregation does not occur. Within this theory, a deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium is introduced for high undercoolings via gradient flow relaxation of the phase field.

To ascertain the interface effects, we investigate the dynamical and structural properties of two ILs in nanoscale confinement at various temperatures. Specifically, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations for ILs composed of 1-butyl-3methylimidazolium cations and hexafluorophosphate ([Bmim][PF6]) or tetrafluoroborate ([Bmim][BF4]) anions sandwiched between amorphous silica slabs. Analyses of the structure indicate a bilayered arrangement in the interfacial region and preferred cation orientation at the surface with the methyl groups pointing toward the wall and the butyl tails projected inward. Mean square displacements and incoherent scattering functions reveal slowed and heterogeneous dynamics of all ionic species in the slit pore. In particular, spatially resolved analyses show that the structural relaxation times increase by about 2 orders of magnitude when approaching the silica surfaces. The altered structural and dynamical features of the confined ILs can be related to an existence of preferred sites for the anions on the amorphous silica surfaces. Detailed analyses of relations between the broadly distributed site and the surface properties show that particularly stable anion sites result when triangular arrangements of silanol groups enable multiple hydrogen bonds with the various fluorine atoms of a given anion, elucidating an important trapping mechanism at the silica surface.},

A better understanding of this process would benefit many areas of science and technology such as medicine, biology, and atmospheric and material sciences. In the present work the temperature dependence of the rate of growth (melting) of the basal face of hexagonal ice Ih and the effect of system size are investigated in molecular dynamics simulations. Using an effective pair potential model of water, systems are studied over temperatures ranging from TM − 40 to TM +16 K, where TM is the melting temperature of the model. It is found that the growth rates reach a maximum value of 0.7 Å ns−1 (7 cm s−1) at about 12 K below the melting temperature. A noticeable effect of the system size on the melting temperature and ice growth rates is observed; it is shown that the size effect arises in smaller systems due to the artificial ordering under periodic conditions. The decrease in melting entropy in the smallest system by 0.4 J (mol K)−1 relative to the largest system results in an up-shift in the melting temperature by about 2 K. An almost 60\% increase in the maximum growth rate is observed for the smallest system.},

  abstract = {Crystal structure prediction involves a search of a complex configurational space for local minima corresponding to stable crystal structures, which can be performed efficiently using atom–atom force fields for the assessment of intermolecular interactions. However, for challenging systems, the limitations in the accuracy of force fields prevent a reliable assessment of the relative thermodynamic stability of potential structures, while the cost of fully quantum mechanical approaches can limit applications of the methods. We present a method to rapidly improve force field lattice energies by correcting two-body interactions with a higher level of theory in a fragment-based approach and predicting these corrections with machine learning. Corrected lattice energies with commonly used density functionals and second order perturbation theory (MP2) all significantly improve the ranking of experimentally known polymorphs where the rigid molecule model is applicable. The relative lattice energies of known polymorphs are also found to systematically improve with the fragment corrections. Predicting two-body interactions with atom-centered symmetry functions in a Gaussian process is found to give highly accurate results using as little as 10–20\% of the data for training, reducing the cost of the energy correction by up to an order of magnitude. The machine learning approach opens up the possibility of more widespread use of fragment-based methods in crystal structure prediction, whose increased accuracy at a low computational cost will benefit applications in areas such as polymorph screening and computer-guided materials discovery.},

The interaction between boundaries which may lead to their annihilation at higher temperatures, which is a problem when 3D periodic borders are applied, is thus avoided. As an application, the method is used to study the stability of a grain boundary at high temperatures.

On the one hand, MGs are amorphous materials with no long-range structural order; on the other hand, topological and chemical short-to-medium range order is expected to be pronounced in these alloys, due to their high atomic packing density and the varying chemical affinity between the constituent elements. The unique internal structure of MGs underlies their interesting properties, which render MGs potentially useful for various applications. While more and more glass-forming alloys have been developed in recent years, fundamental knowledge on the structural aspect of MGs remains seriously lacking. For example, how atoms pack on the short-to-medium range, how the structure differs in different MGs and changes with composition, temperature, and processing history, and more importantly, how the structure influences the properties of MGs, are still unresolved questions. In this paper, we review the tremendous efforts over the past 50years devoted to unraveling the atomic-level structure of MGs and the structural origin of their unique behaviors. Emphasis will be placed on the progress made in recent years, including advances in structural characterization and analysis of prototypical MGs, general structural models and fundamental principles, and the correlations of thermodynamic, kinetic, and mechanical properties with the MG structures. Some widely observed property–property correlations in MGs are also examined from the structural perspective. The insights summarized are shown to shed light on many intriguing behaviors of the MG-forming alloys and expected to impact the development of MGs. Outstanding questions in this important research area will also be outlined.},

The discrepancy of the results obtained by different criteria is discovered. Heat capacity dependence on temperature agrees qualitatively with theoretical and experimental results. Influence of cooling rate on the glass transition temperature is studied. Although different methods give different glass transition temperatures, the dependencies on cooling rate may be interpreted in the Volkenstein and Ptitsyn's framework using either Arrhenius or Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann relaxation laws.},

A slowing down of the growth kinetics along the coexistence line is observed, which is due to the decrease of the melting enthalpy with increasing coexistence temperature and pressure. Other quantities such as the melting pressure and liquid self-diffusion coefficient have a comparatively lesser impact on the kinetic growth coefficient. Growth kinetics of the LJ and WCA potentials become similar at large values of the melting temperature and pressure, when both resemble a purely repulsive soft-sphere potential. Classical models of crystallization from the melt are in reasonable qualitative agreement with our simulation data. Finally, several one-phase empirical melting/freezing rules are studied with respect to their validity along the coexistence line.},

The tantalizing colours of precious opals and the colour of some species of birds are examples of polycrystalline colloidal structures found in nature. Driven by the demands of several emergent technologies, efforts have been made to develop efficient, self-assembly-based methodologies for generating colloidal single crystals with well-defined morphologies. Somewhat unfortunately, these efforts are often frustrated by the formation of structures lacking long-range order. Here we show that the rational design of patch shape and symmetry can drive patchy colloids to crystallize in a single, selected morphology by structurally eliminating undesired polymorphs. We provide a proof of this concept through the numerical investigation of triblock Janus colloids. One particular choice of patch symmetry yields, via spontaneous crystallization, a pure tetrastack lattice, a structure with attractive photonic properties, whereas another one results in a colloidal clathrate-like structure, in both cases without any interfering polymorphs.},

In this article we test this suggestion using a single-component Yukawa fluid as a reference system. The available simulation data on self-diffusion in Yukawa fluids, complemented with new data for Yukawa melts (Yukawa fluids near the freezing phase transition), are carefully analyzed. It is shown that although not exact, this earlier suggestion nevertheless provides a very sensible way of normalization of the self-diffusion constant. Additionally, we demonstrate that certain quantitative properties of self-diffusion in Yukawa melts are also shared by systems like one-component plasma and liquid metals at freezing, providing support to an emerging dynamical freezing indicator for simple soft matter systems. The obtained results are also briefly discussed in the context of the theory of momentum transfer in complex (dusty) plasmas.},

It then presents an assortment of examples of recent machine learning applications within materials science. The chapter also discusses a range of emerging efforts, including high-throughput phase diagram and crystal structure determination methods, accelerated prediction of materials properties, development of interatomic potentials and functionals for accelerating materials simulations, and efficient and low-cost methods for materials process control.},

We focus primarily on the regression of “double error” data, or x−y data pairs, where both variables are measurements subject to error (e.g., isochron fitting), but the methods we discuss are general and can be applied to any nonlinear regression. We review the differences between least squares and maximum likelihood methods and describe how maximum likelihood can be naturally extended to permit robust regressions that are relatively insensitive to outliers. We describe the bootstrap technique for the estimation of the standard error and confidence intervals of a model and show how it can be used to sidestep the mathematical intractability of estimating uncertainty in nonlinear regressions. We illustrate the application of these methods through examples using synthetic and real data and demonstrate how they can influence statistical perception of nonlinear parameter estimates. In particular, we demonstrate how the linearized methods that are commonly used to make uncertainty estimates can substantially underestimate model error, and we show how this problem can be addressed with bootstrap confidence intervals that automatically adjust to account for intrinsic asymmetry and non-Gaussian behavior in a regression. We include computer code to implement the calculations we describe as supplements to this article.},

  abstract = {We discuss the following problem: given a random sample X=(X1,X2,⋯,Xn)X=(X1,X2,⋯,Xn)\textbackslash{}mathbf\{X\} = (X\_1, X\_2, \textbackslash{}cdots, X\_n) from an unknown probability distribution FFF, estimate the sampling distribution of some prespecified random variable R(X,F)R(X,F)R(\textbackslash{}mathbf\{X\}, F), on the basis of the observed data xx\textbackslash{}mathbf\{x\}. (Standard jackknife theory gives an approximate mean and variance in the case R(X,F)=θ(F\^)−θ(F),θR(X,F)=θ(F\^)−θ(F),θR(\textbackslash{}mathbf\{X\}, F) = \textbackslash{}theta(\textbackslash{}hat\{F\}) - \textbackslash{}theta(F), \textbackslash{}theta some parameter of interest.) A general method, called the "bootstrap," is introduced, and shown to work satisfactorily on a variety of estimation problems. The jackknife is shown to be a linear approximation method for the bootstrap. The exposition proceeds by a series of examples: variance of the sample median, error rates in a linear discriminant analysis, ratio estimation, estimating regression parameters, etc.},

The new MD method is extended to treat molecular systems and to include long range charge-charge interactions. Results on the conservation laws, the frequency of oscillation of the MD cell, and the equations which constrain the shape of the MD cell are also given. An additional constraint is introduced to stop the superfluous MD cell rotation which would otherwise complicate the analysis of crystal structures. The method is illustrated by examining the behaviour of solid nitrogen at high pressure.},

  abstract = {The Debye-Stokes-Einstein (DSE) model of rotational diffusion predicts that the orientational correlation times τl vary as [l(l+1)]−1, where l is the rank of the orientational time correlation function (given in terms of the Legendre polynomial of rank l). One often finds significant deviation from this prediction, in either direction. In supercooled molecular liquids where the ratio τ1∕τ2 falls considerably below 3 (the Debye limit), one usually invokes a jump diffusion model to explain the approach of the ratio τ1∕τ2 to unity. Here we show in a computer simulation study of a standard model system for thermotropic liquid crystals that this ratio becomes much less than unity as the isotropic-nematic phase boundary is approached from the isotropic side. Simultaneously, the ratio τ2∕η, η being the shear viscosity of the liquid, becomes much larger than the hydrodynamic value near the I−N transition. We also analyze the breakdown of the Debye model of rotational diffusion in ratios of higher order orientational correlation times. We show that the breakdown of the DSE model is due to the growth of orientational pair correlation and provide a mode coupling theory analysis to explain the results.},

The new implementation extends the functionality of the original version, provides a much more convenient user interface (both graphical/interactive and batch), and can be used as a tool set for implementing new analysis modules. This was made possible by the use of a high-level language, Python, and of modern object-oriented programming techniques. The quantities that can be calculated by nMoldyn are the mean-square displacement, the velocity autocorrelation function as well as its Fourier transform (the density of states) and its memory function, the angular velocity autocorrelation function and its Fourier transform, the reorientational correlation function, and several functions specific to neutron scattering: the coherent and incoherent intermediate scattering functions with their Fourier transforms, the memory function of the coherent scattering function, and the elastic incoherent structure factor. The possibility to compute memory function is a new and powerful feature that allows to relate simulation results to theoretical studies. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It runs in serial mode on a conventional workstation or on a parallel system using an interface to a parallel communications library such as MPI or BSP. The “replicated data” parallelization strategy is used to achieve reasonable performance with a minimal difference between serial and parallel code. The code has been optimized for high performance in both serial and parallel cases. The model system is completely specified in a run-time input file and may contain atoms, molecules or ions in any mixture. Molecules or molecular ions are treated in the rigid-molecule approximation and their rotational motion is modeled using quaternion methods. The equations of motion are integrated using a modified form of the Beeman algorithm. Simulations may be performed in the usual NVE ensemble or in isobaric and/or isothermal ensembles. Potential functions of the Lennard–Jones, 6-exp and MCY forms are supported and the code is structured to give an straightforward interface to add a new functional form. The Ewald method is used to calculate long-ranged electrostatic forces.},

Simulated free energy surfaces obtained at various distances between the rotating acetamide and its initial and final H-bond acceptors have been found to be symmetric double-well in nature at the transition state. H-bond relaxation times obtained from our simulations corroborate well with the time scales associated with the jump and waiting time distributions, suggesting an interrelationship between jump dynamics and H-bond fluctuations.

The nature of the plate has been tuned from hydrophobic to hydrophilic and vice versa by varying plate-water dispersion interaction. Analyses of the translational dynamics as performed by calculating mean squared displacements of the confined water reveal a monotonically decreasing trend of the diffusivity with increasing hydrophilicity of the plates. Orientational dynamics of the confined water also follows the same monotonic trend. Although orientational time constant almost does not change with the increase of plate-water dispersion interaction in the hydrophobic regime corresponding to the smaller plate-water attraction, it changes considerably in the hydrophilic regime corresponding to larger plate-water dispersion interactions.},

  abstract = {We have developed a time-reversible rigid-body (rRB) molecular dynamics algorithm in the isothermalisobaric (NPT) ensemble. The algorithm is an extension of rigid-body dynamics [Matubayasi and Nakahara, J Chem Phys 1999, 110, 3291] to the NPT ensemble on the basis of non-Hamiltonian statistical mechanics [Martyna, G. J. et al., J Chem Phys 1994, 101, 4177]. A series of MD simulations of water as well as fully hydrated lipid bilayer systems have been undertaken to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm. The rRB algorithm was shown to be superior to the state-of-the-art constraint-dynamics algorithm SHAKE/RATTLE/ROLL, with respect to computational efficiency. However, it was revealed that both algorithms produced accurate trajectories of molecules in the NPT as well as NVT ensembles, as long as a reasonably short time step was used. A couple of multiple time-step (MTS) integration schemes were also examined. The advantage of the rRB algorithm for computational efficiency increased when the MD simulation was carried out using MTS on parallel processing computer systems; total computer time for MTS-MD of a lipid bilayer using 64 processors was reduced by about 40\% using rRB instead of SHAKE/RATTLE/ROLL.},

  abstract = {The question of whether the dramatic slowing down of the dynamics of glass-forming liquids near the structural glass transition is caused by the growth of one or more correlation lengths has received much attention in recent years. Several proposals have been made for both static and dynamic length scales that may be responsible for the growth of timescales as the glass transition is approached. These proposals are critically examined with emphasis on the dynamic length scale associated with spatial heterogeneity of local dynamics and the static point-to-set or mosaic length scale of the random firstorder transition theory of equilibrium glass transition. Available results for these length scales, obtained mostly from simulations, are summarized, and the relation of the growth of timescales near the glass transition with the growth of these length scales is examined. Some of the outstanding questions about length scales in glass-forming liquids are discussed, and studies in which these questions may be addressed are suggested.},

This book, first published in 2004, is a blend of tutorial and recipe collection, providing both an introduction to the subject for beginners and a reference manual for the more experienced practitioner. It is organized as a series of case studies that take the reader through each of the steps from formulating the problem, developing the necessary software, and then using the programs to make actual measurements.

Frustration in this context describes an incompatibility between extension of the locally preferred order in a liquid and tiling of the whole space. We provide a critical assessment of what has been achieved within this approach and we discuss its relation with other theories of the glass transition.},

  abstract = {We have re-calculated the self part of the density autocorrelation function Fs(k,t) (incoherent scattering function) for the binary soft-sphere fluid with a much longer molecular-dynamics (MD) simulation than our previous MD calculations, and with a larger system size (N = 4OOO) to a longer time window as well as to study a system-sizedependence, if it exists. The full density autocorrelation function F ( k ,t ) was also computed. It is found that all F ( k , t) ‘s that we have computed in this work can be fitted over a wide range of time steps (at least over three figures of the decay) by a Williams-Watts stretched exponential function F,(k, t) = A exp[ - (t/to)’],where A, fl and to are adjustable parameters. Other significant dynamical behaviours were also presented in mean square displacements and non-Gaussian parameters for highly supercooled fluids with N = 4000. The present results are compatible to our previous computations with N = 500, but a significant size dependence is suggested.},

  abstract = {Glasses can be formed by many routes. In some cases, distinct polyamorphic forms are found. The normal mode of glass formation is cooling of a viscous liquid. Liquid behavior during cooling is classified between "strong" and "fragile," and the three canonical characteristics of relaxing liquids are correlated through the fragility. Strong liquids become fragile liquids on compression. In some cases, such conversions occur during cooling by a weak first-order transition. This behavior can be related to the polymorphism in a glass state through a recent simple modification of the van der Waals model for tetrahedrally bonded liquids. The sudden loss of some liquid degrees of freedom through such first-order transitions is suggestive of the polyamorphic transition between native and denatured hydrated proteins, which can be interpreted as single-chain glass-forming polymers plasticized by water and cross-linked by hydrogen bonds. The onset of a sharp change in d{$<$}r2{$>$}dT({$<$}r2{$>$} is the Debye-Waller factor and T is temperature) in proteins, which is controversially indentified with the glass transition in liquids, is shown to be general for glass formers and observable in computer simulations of strong and fragile ionic liquids, where it proves to be close to the experimental glass transition temperature. The latter may originate in strong anharmonicity in modes ("bosons"), which permits the system to access multiple minima of its configuration space. These modes, the Kauzmann temperature TK, and the fragility of the liquid, may thus be connected.},

It seems to me that we have too often been led astray by sophisticated mathematical models that beautifully capture some of the most intriguing features of glassy behavior, but are too unrealistic to provide bases for predictive theories. As illustrations of what I mean, the first part of this article is devoted to brief summaries of imaginative, sensible, but disparate and often contradictory ideas for solving glass problems. Almost all of these ideas remain alive today, with their own enthusiastic advocates. I then describe numerical simulations, mostly by H Tanaka and coworkers, in which it appears that very simple, polydisperse systems of hard disks and spheres develop long range, Ising-like, bond-orientational order as they approach glass transitions. Finally, I summarize my recent proposal that topologically ordered clusters of particles, in disordered environments, tend to become aligned with each other as if they were two-state systems, and thus produce the observed Ising-like behavior. Neither Tanaka's results nor my proposed interpretation of them fit comfortably within any of the currently popular glass theories.},

The structural unit model is used as a benchmark to evaluate the atomic structure description capacities of an emerging structural descriptor, the local environment representation, which itself is a refinement of the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptor. We show that the local environment representation encodes both the information of the structural unit model and additional information, such as distortion in the structural units and the arrangement of the structural units at the interface. The use of the local environment representation permits the use of a visualization tool known as SPRING to represent structural similarities between grain boundaries. With the SPRING representation, we produce objective evidence of a relationship between crystallography and atomic structure, at least for ½1 0 0 - symmetric tilt grain boundaries.},

  abstract = {Grain boundaries (GBs) influence a wide array of physical properties in polycrystalline materials and play an important role in governing microstructural evolution under extreme environments. While the importance of interfaces is well documented, their properties are among the least understood of all the defect types present in engineering material systems. This is due to the vast configurational space of interfaces, resulting in a diverse range of structures and properties. The complexity associated with GB structures is related to the different crystallographic degrees of freedom – the misorientation, the boundary-plane orientation and the relative translations between the adjoining crystals. These unique challenges can be addressed by leveraging highthroughput simulations of GB properties and developing machine learning algorithms grounded in the concepts of bicrystallography of interfaces. To demystify the relationships between crystallography and properties, the symmetry aspects of GBs are reviewed with an emphasis on boundary-plane orientations and disconnection line defects. To quantify structure-property relationships, recent advances in describing GB structures using the polyhedral unit model and the gaussian-based approximation of local atomic environments are discussed. Finally, examples of predicting GB structure-property relationships using machine learning techniques are summarized. As part of a special issue, the goal of this review article is to motivate machine learning strategies that are informed by bicrystallography and novel structural descriptors for developing reliable crystallographystructure-property relationships for grain boundaries.},

  abstract = {Clathrate hydrates and ice I are the most abundant crystals of water. The study of their nucleation, growth, and decomposition using molecular simulations requires an accurate and efficient algorithm that distinguishes water molecules that belong to each of these crystals and the liquid phase. Existing algorithms identify ice or clathrates, but not both. This poses a challenge for cases in which ice and hydrate coexist, such as in the synthesis of clathrates from ice and the formation of ice from clathrates during self-preservation of methane hydrates. Here we present an efficient algorithm for the identification of clathrate hydrates, hexagonal ice, cubic ice, and liquid water in molecular simulations. CHILL+ uses the number of staggered and eclipsed water–water bonds to identify water molecules in cubic ice, hexagonal ice, and clathrate hydrate. CHILL+ is an extension of CHILL (Moore et al. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2010, 12, 4124–4134), which identifies hexagonal and cubic ice but not clathrates. In addition to the identification of hydrates, CHILL+ significantly improves the detection of hexagonal ice up to its melting point. We validate the use of CHILL+ for the identification of stacking faults in ice and the nucleation and growth of clathrate hydrates. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that allows for the simultaneous identification of ice and clathrate hydrates, and it does so in a way that is competitive with respect to existing methods used to identify any of these crystals.},

We present three studies of how they are using notebooks to document and share exploratory data analyses. In the first, we analyzed over 1 million computational notebooks on GitHub, finding that one in four had no explanatory text but consisted entirely of visualizations or code. In a second study, we examined over 200 academic computational notebooks, finding that although the vast majority described methods, only a minority discussed reasoning or results. In a third study, we interviewed 15 academic data analysts, finding that most considered computational notebooks personal, exploratory, and messy. Importantly, they typically used other media to share analyses. These studies demonstrate a tension between exploration and explanation in constructing and sharing computational notebooks. We conclude with opportunities to encourage explanation in computational media without hindering exploration.},

Solving this equation by hand for a one-dimensional system is a manageable task, but it becomes time-consuming once students aim to make various changes and investigate the impact of those changes on the results. To address this challenge, numerical methods, such as the shooting and linear finite-difference methods, have been utilized to quickly solve Schrödinger’s equation. In this technology report, we use the Python programming environment and the three-point finite-difference numerical method to find the solutions and plot the results (wave functions or probability densities) for a particle in an infinite, finite, double finite, harmonic, Morse, or Kronig–Penney finite potential energy well.

RATTLE calculates the positions and velocities at the next time from the positions and velocities at the present time step, without requiring information about the earlier history. Like SHAKE, it is based on the Verlet algorithm and retains the simplicity of using Cartesian coordinates for each of the atoms to describe the configuration of a molecule with internal constraints. RATTLE guarantees that the coordinates and velocities of the atoms in a molecule satisfy the internal constraints at each time step. RATTLE has two advantages over SHAKE. On computers of fixed precision, it is of higher precision than SHAKE. Since it deals directly with the velocities, it is easier to modify RATTLE for use with the recently developed constant temperature and constant pressure molecular dynamics methods and with the nonequilibrium molecular dynamics methods that make use of rescaling of the atomic velocities.},

At temperatures below Tk, the crystal would have a greater entropy than its liquid. Such a catastrophe is avoided through a glass transition of the liquid above Tk. Fecht and Johnson2 have shown that such a transition should occur for aluminium at 0.23 Tm. A similar entropy catastrophe can also arise at a temperature, TiS, above Tm. Above TiS, the crystalline solid is once again expected to have an entropy greater than that of the liquid. Cahn3 has considered the implications of this idea with respect to the superheating of a solid. Here we present an alternative evaluation of the two temperatures of instability, Tk and TiS, from experimentally measurable parameters. Results for alkali metals show that the Kauzmann-type entropy catastrophe occurs at about half the absolute melting temperature, whereas we find that the entropy catastrophe as described by Fecht and Johnson2 occurs at twice the absolute melting temperature. For most solids, vaporization will probably intervene before the entropy catastrophe temperature above the melting temperature is reached.},

Both phenomenological and microscopic density functional approaches are discussed. Particular emphasis is placed on colloidal suspensions, which are realizations of simple liquids on a mesoscopic length scale that also exhibit melting and freezing phenomena.},

  abstract = {The early stages of crystallization are not fully understood, a particularly challenging problem being crystallization from solution. The processes involved at an atomic level remain elusive to experiment. Furthermore, crystallization from solution has been thought to be inaccessible by atomistic computer simulations. This study demonstrates that crystallization from solution can in fact be simulated using the method of molecular dynamics for a model solute/solvent system consisting of atomic species characterized by the Lennard-Jones potential function. The model has been applied to look at the effects of varying supersaturation and of inclusion of a simple inhibitor in the system. The behavior of the model is in accord with experiment. In general, increasing supersaturation causes earlier onset of crystallization. Crystallization in highly supersaturated systems involves liquid-liquid phase separation followed by nucleation in the solute phase. The nucleation event in such systems does not appear to be influenced by the solvent. Inclusion of inhibitors retards the onset. Additionally, extensive solute clustering is observed. The crystallization model and variations on it, as well as step by step extension to realistic systems, should enable further testing and development of theory of crystal nucleation and growth and provide insights of technological importance.},

  abstract = {Despite progress in the understanding of crystal nucleation and crystal growth since the first theories for nucleation were developed, an exact quantitative prediction of the nucleation rates in most systems has remained an unsolved problem. Colloidal suspensions show a phase behavior that is analogous to atomic or molecular systems and serve accordingly as ideal model systems for studying crystal nucleation with an accuracy and depth on a microscopic scale that is hard to reach for atomic or molecular systems. Due to the mesoscopic size of colloidal particles they can be studied in detail on the single-particle level and their dynamics is strongly slowed down in comparison with atomic or molecular systems, such that the formation of a crystal nucleus can be followed in detail. In this review, recent progress in the study of homogeneous and heterogeneous crystal nucleation in colloids and the controlled growth of crystalline colloidal structures is reviewed. All this work has resulted in unprecedented insights into the early stage of nucleation and it is also relevant for a deeper understanding of soft matter materials in general as well as for possible applications based on colloidal suspensions.},

We report the two-dimensional dense packing patterns of bending and assembled rods, which are non-convexly deformed from simple objects and modeled as entangled particles. Monte Carlo simulations and further analytical constructions are carried out to explore possible densely packed structures. Two typical densely packed structures of C-bending rods are found, and their packing densities are identified as being functions of the aspect ratio and central angle. Six shapes of assembled rods, representing the combined deformations of rods, are employed in simulations with the packing structures classified into three types. The dense packing density of each packing pattern is derived as a function of different shape parameters. In contrast with the case of disordered packings, both the shape and order are verified to affect the packing density.},

Details are presented of an A3B binary hard sphere packing obtained by simulated annealing in an isopointal set 62cd/c. The structure has a higher density than all known others when the sphere radius ratio rA/rB is between 0.619 and 0.659786. This extends the known range over which compound binary sphere packings can exceed the density of phase-separated fcc packing. Previously, no packings were known to exceed this mark between a radius ratio of 0.62 and 1.0. The structure of interest has a peak density of 0.747857, which occurs at a radius ratio of 0.647989. A related dense packing is also discussed, which has a peak density of 0.7573 at a size ratio of 0.5147. This latter structure is the densest known noninterstitial compound packing when the mixture has three small spheres for every large sphere, at any size ratio. Both structures are likely candidates for stability in binary hard sphere phase diagrams at this composition, but neither has so far been observed experimentally.},

Compared to pure metals, the kinetic coefficients of the ordered systems are smaller by at least an order of magnitude. For the first time, we show here that the growth kinetics of ordered Ni3Al is very sluggish compared to that of the disordered system. The difference is attributed to the diffusion limited growth in the ordered systems vis-á-vis the interface limited growth in their counterpart. Theoretical models by Broughton-Gilmer-Jackson and Wilson-Frenkel are employed to corroborate the identified growth mechanisms.

  abstract = {We identify putatively maximally dense packings of tangent-sphere trimers with fixed bond angles (\$\textbackslash{}theta = \textbackslash{}theta\_0\$) using a novel method, and contrast them to the disordered jammed states they form under quasistatic and dynamic athermal compression. Incommensurability of \$\textbackslash{}theta\_0\$ with 3D close-packing does not by itself inhibit formation of dense 3D crystals; all \$\textbackslash{}theta\_0\$ allow formation of crystals with \$\textbackslash{}phi\_\{max\}(\textbackslash{}theta\_0) {$>$} 0.97\textbackslash{}phi\_\{cp\}\$. Trimers are always able to arrange into periodic structures composed of close-packed bilayers or trilayers of triangular-lattice planes, separated by ``gap layers'' that accomodate the incommensurability. All systems have \$\textbackslash{}phi\_J\$ significantly below the monomeric value, indicating that trimers' quenched bond-length and bond-angle constraints always act to promote jamming. \$\textbackslash{}phi\_J\$ varies strongly with \$\textbackslash{}theta\_0\$; straight (\$\textbackslash{}theta\_0 = 0\$) trimers minimize \$\textbackslash{}phi\_J\$ while closed (\$\textbackslash{}theta\_0 = 120\^\textbackslash{}circ\$) trimers maximize it. Marginally jammed states of trimers with lower \$\textbackslash{}phi\_J(\textbackslash{}theta\_0)\$ exhibit quantifiably greater disorder, and the lower \$\textbackslash{}phi\_J\$ for small \$\textbackslash{}theta\_0\$ is apparently caused by trimers' decreasing effective configurational freedom as they approach linearity.},

  abstract = {The melting transition of two-dimensional systems is a fundamental problem in condensed matter and statistical physics that has advanced significantly through the application of computational resources and algorithms. Two-dimensional systems present the opportunity for novel phases and phase transition scenarios not observed in 3D systems, but these phases depend sensitively on the system and, thus, predicting how any given 2D system will behave remains a challenge. Here, we report a comprehensive simulation study of the phase behavior near the melting transition of all hard regular polygons with 3≤n≤14 vertices using massively parallel Monte Carlo simulations of up to 1×106 particles. By investigating this family of shapes, we show that the melting transition depends upon both particle shape and symmetry considerations, which together can predict which of three different melting scenarios will occur for a given n. We show that systems of polygons with as few as seven edges behave like hard disks; they melt continuously from a solid to a hexatic fluid and then undergo a first-order transition from the hexatic phase to the isotropic fluid phase. We show that this behavior, which holds for all 7≤n≤14, arises from weak entropic forces among the particles. Strong directional entropic forces align polygons with fewer than seven edges and impose local order in the fluid. These forces can enhance or suppress the discontinuous character of the transition depending on whether the local order in the fluid is compatible with the local order in the solid. As a result, systems of triangles, squares, and hexagons exhibit a Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) predicted continuous transition between isotropic fluid and triatic, tetratic, and hexatic phases, respectively, and a continuous transition from the appropriate x-atic to the solid. In particular, we find that systems of hexagons display continuous two-step KTHNY melting. In contrast, due to symmetry incompatibility between the ordered fluid and solid, systems of pentagons and plane-filling fourfold pentilles display a one-step first-order melting of the solid to the isotropic fluid with no intermediate phase.},

Not all high-dimensional data exhibit these characteristics because many data sets have correlations, which led to the notion of intrinsic dimensionality. Intrinsic dimensionality describes the local behavior of data on a low-dimensional manifold within the higher dimensional space.We discuss this effect, and describe a surprisingly simple approach modification that allows us to reduce local intrinsic dimensionality of individual points. While this unlikely will be able to “cure” all problems associated with high dimensionality, we show the theoretical impact on idealized distributions and how to practically incorporate it into new, more robust, algorithms. To demonstrate the effect of this adjustment, we introduce the novel Intrinsic Stochastic Outlier Score (ISOS), and we propose modifications of the popular t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualization technique for intrinsic dimensionality, intrinsic t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (it-SNE).},

Patterns of gene expression can be used to characterize and classify neuronal types. It is challenging, however, to generate taxonomies that fulfill the essential criteria of being comprehensive, harmonizing with conventional classification schemes, and lacking superfluous subdivisions of genuine types. To address these challenges, we used massively parallel single-cell RNA profiling and optimized computational methods on a heterogeneous class of neurons, mouse retinal bipolar cells (BCs). From a population of ∼25,000 BCs, we derived a molecular classification that identified 15 types, including all types observed previously and two novel types, one of which has a~non-canonical morphology and position. We validated the classification scheme and identified dozens of novel markers using methods that match molecular expression to cell morphology. This work provides a systematic methodology for achieving comprehensive molecular classification of neurons, identifies novel neuronal types, and uncovers transcriptional differences that distinguish types within a class.},

Computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets are well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating-point arithmetic, this assumption can lead to serious errors. We briefly describe a solution to this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or four dimensions. The output is a set of “thick ” facets that contain all possible exact convex hulls of the input. A variation is effective in five or more dimensions.},

Given n sets, this procedure permits their reduction to n − 1 mutually exclusive sets by considering the union of all possible n(n − 1)/2 pairs and selecting a union having a maximal value for the functional relation, or objective function, that reflects the criterion chosen by the investigator. By repeating this process until only one group remains, the complete hierarchical structure and a quantitative estimate of the loss associated with each stage in the grouping can be obtained. A general flowchart helpful in computer programming and a numerical example are included.},

It provides general implementations of the classical statistical tests for RNGs, as well as several others tests proposed in the literature, and some original ones. Predefined tests suites for sequences of uniform random numbers over the interval (0, 1) and for bit sequences are available. Tools are also offered to perform systematic studies of the interaction between a specific test and the structure of the point sets produced by a given family of RNGs. That is, for a given kind of test and a given class of RNGs, to determine how large should be the sample size of the test, as a function of the generator's period length, before the generator starts to fail the test systematically. Finally, the library provides various types of generators implemented in generic form, as well as many specific generators proposed in the literature or found in widely used software. The tests can be applied to instances of the generators predefined in the library, or to user-defined generators, or to streams of random numbers produced by any kind of device or stored in files. Besides introducing TestU01, the article provides a survey and a classification of statistical tests for RNGs. It also applies batteries of tests to a long list of widely used RNGs.},

  abstract = {Often, in a regression situation with many variables, a sequence of submodels is generated containing fewer variables by using such methods as stepwise addition or deletion of variables, or 'best subsets'. The question is which of this sequence of submodels is 'best', and how can submodel performance be evaluated. This was explored in Breiman (1988) for a fixed X-design. This is a sequel exploring the case of random X-designs. Analytical results are difficult, if not impossible. This study involved an extensive simulation. The basis of the study is the theoretical definition of prediction error (PE) as the expected squared error produced by applying a prediction equation to the distributional universe of (y, x) values. This definition is used throughout to compare various submodels. There can be startling differences between the x-fixed and x-random situations and different PE estimates are appropriate. Non-resampling estimates such as CP, adjusted R2, etc. turn out to be highly biased methods for submodel selection. The two best methods are cross-validation and bootstrap. One surprise is that 5 fold cross-validation (leave out 20\% of the data) is better at submodel selection and evaluation than leave-one-out cross-validation. There are a number of other surprises. /// Dans l'analyse de problèmes de régression à plusieurs variables (indépendantes), on produit souvent une série de sous-modèles constitués d'un sous-ensemble des variables par des méthodes telles que l'addition par étape, le retrait par étape et la méthode du meilleur sous-ensemble. Le problème est de déterminer lequel de ces sous-modèles est le meilleur et d'évaluer sa performance. Ce problème fut exploré dans Breiman (1988) pour le cas d'une matrice X fixe. Dans ce qui suit on considère le cas où la matrice X est aléatoire. La détermination de résultats analytiques est difficile, sinon impossible. Notre étude a utilisé des simulations de grande envergure. Elle se base sur la définition théorique de l'erreur de prédiction (EP) comme étant l'espérance du carré de l'erreur produite en applicant une équation de prédiction à l'univers distributional des valeurs (y, x). La définition est utilisée dans toute l'étude à fin de comparer divers sous-modèles. Il y a une différence étonnante entre le cas où la matrice X est fixée et celui où elle est aléatoire. Différents estimateurs de la EP sont à propos. Les estimateurs n'utilisant pas de ré-échantillonage, tels que le Cp et le R2 ajusté, produisent des méthodes de sélection ayant grand biais. Les deux meilleures méthodes sont la validation croisée et l'autoamorçage. Une surprise est que la validation croisée quintuple est meilleure que la validation croisée tous sauf un. Il y a plusieurs autres résultats surprenants.},

On the other hand, cross-validation is no more or less a form of bias than simpler strategies, and applying it appropriately ultimately depends in the same way on prior knowledge. In fact, cross-validation may be seen as a way of applying partial information about the applicability of alternative classification strategies.},

A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an n record file are: insertion, O(log n); deletion of the root, O(n(k-1)/k); deletion of a random node, O(log n); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches), O(n log n). Search algorithms are given for partial match queries with t keys specified [proven maximum running time of O(n(k-t)/k)] and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average running time of O(log n).] These performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms for these tasks. An algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query. The main focus of this paper is theoretical. It is felt, however, that k-d trees could be quite useful in many applications, and examples of potential uses are given.},

It is shown that the intuitively defined Lattman metric [1] is a scalar multiple of the metric tensor which arises naturally from the Jacobi formulation of the action principle for spherical tops. It is then shown that Euler's quaternion parameters lead to a euclidean form for the orientation metric. These parameters lead to many associated simplifications in the equations of motion of classical rigid bodies including the removal of singularities and spurious behaviour near θ = 0. It is felt that these benefits will translate into increased accuracy and efficiency both for numerical integration of the equations of motion and for performing Monte Carlo integrations of phase space.},

In this paper we describe the restriction of such searches to predefined isopointal sets, breaking the problem into countable sub-problems which exploit crystal symmetries to reduce the dimensionality of the search space. Applying this method to the search for maximally packed mixtures of hard spheres of two sizes, we demonstrate that the densest packed structures can be identified by searches within a couple of isopointal sets. For the A2B system, the densest known packings over the entire tested range 0.2 {$<$} rA/rB {$<$} 2.5, including some improvements on previous optima, can all be identified by searches within a single isopointal set. In the case of the AB composition, searches of two isopointal sets generate the densest packed structures over the radius ratio range 0.2 {$<$} rA/rB {$<$} 5.0.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in molecular simulations allow the evaluation of previously unattainable observables, such as rate constants for protein folding. However, these calculations are usually computationally expensive, and even significant computing resources may result in a small number of independent estimates spread over many orders of magnitude. Such small-sample, high “log-variance” data are not readily amenable to analysis using the standard uncertainty (i.e., “standard error of the mean”) because unphysical negative limits of confidence intervals result. Bootstrapping, a natural alternative guaranteed to yield a confidence interval within the minimum and maximum values, also exhibits a striking systematic bias of the lower confidence limit in log space. As we show, bootstrapping artifactually assigns high probability to improbably low mean values. A second alternative, the Bayesian bootstrap strategy, does not suffer from the same deficit and is more logically consistent with the type of confidence interval desired. The Bayesian bootstrap provides uncertainty intervals that are more reliable than those from the standard bootstrap method but must be used with caution nevertheless. Neither standard nor Bayesian bootstrapping can overcome the intrinsic challenge of underestimating the mean from small-size, high log-variance samples. Our conclusions are based on extensive analysis of model distributions and reanalysis of multiple independent atomistic simulations. Although we only analyze rate constants, similar considerations will apply to related calculations, potentially including highly nonlinear averages like the Jarzynski relation.},

  abstract = {Liquids are often assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic at any lengthscale and translationally invariant. The standard liquid-state theory is constructed on the basis of this picture and thus basically described in terms of the two-body density correlation. This picture is certainly valid at rather high temperatures, where a liquid is in a highly disordered state. However, it may not necessarily be valid at low temperatures or for a system which has strong directional bonding. Indeed, there remain fundamental unsolved problems in liquid science, which are difficult to explain by such a theory. They include water's thermodynamic and kinetic anomalies, liquid–liquid transitions, liquid–glass transitions, and liquid–solid transitions. We argue that for the physical description of these phenomena it is crucial to take into account many-body (orientational) correlations, which have been overlooked in the conventional liquid-state theory. It is essential to recognise that a liquid can lower its free energy by local or mesoscopic ordering without breaking global symmetry. Since such ordering must involve at least a central particle and its neighbours, which are more than two particles, it is intrinsically a consequence of many-body correlations. Particularly important ordering is associated with local breakdown of rotational symmetry, i.e., bond orientational ordering. We emphasize that translational ordering is global whereas orientational ordering can be local. Because of the strong first-order nature of translational ordering, its growth in a liquid state is modest. Thus any structural ordering in a liquid should be associated primarily with orientational ordering and not with translational ordering. We show that bond orientational ordering indeed plays a significant role in all the above-mentioned phenomena at least for (quasi-)single-component liquids. In this Introductory Lecture, we discuss how these phenomena can be explained by such local or mesoscopic ordering in a unified manner.},

  abstract = {Despite its fundamental and technological importance, a microscopic understanding of the crystallization process is still elusive. By computer simulations of the hard-sphere model we reveal the mechanism by which thermal fluctuations drive the transition from the supercooled liquid state to the crystal state. In particular we show that fluctuations in bond orientational order trigger the nucleation process, contrary to the common belief that the transition is initiated by density fluctuations. Moreover, the analysis of bond orientational fluctuations shows that these not only act as seeds of the nucleation process, but also i) determine the particular polymorph which is to be nucleated from them and ii) at high density favour the formation of fivefold structures which can frustrate the formation of crystals. These results can shed new light on our understanding of the relationship between crystallization and vitrification.},

  abstract = {There are at least three fundamental states of matter, depending upon temperature and pressure: gas, liquid, and solid (crystal). These states are separated by first-order phase transitions between them. In both gas and liquid phases a complete translational and rotational symmetry exist, whereas in a solid phase both symmetries are broken. In intermediate phases between liquid and solid, which include liquid crystal and plastic crystal phases, only one of the two symmetries is preserved. Among the fundamental states of matter, the liquid state is the most poorly understood. We argue that it is crucial for a better understanding of liquids to recognize that a liquid generally has the tendency to have a local structural order and its presence is intrinsic and universal to any liquid. Such structural ordering is a consequence of many-body correlations, more specifically, bond angle correlations, which we believe are crucial for the description of the liquid state. We show that this physical picture may naturally explain difficult unsolved problems associated with the liquid state, such as anomalies of water-type liquids (water, Si, Ge, ...), liquid-liquid transition, liquid-glass transition, crystallization and quasicrystal formation, in a unified manner. In other words, we need a new order parameter representing a low local free-energy configuration, which is a bond orientational order parameter in many cases, in addition to a density order parameter for the physical description of these phenomena. Here we review our two-order-parameter model of liquid and consider how transient local structural ordering is linked to all of the above-mentioned phenomena. The relationship between these phenomena is also discussed.Graphical abstract Open image in new window},

Density-functional theories (DFT) indicate that the cluster/parent phase interface is broad, that the properties of small clusters are not the same as those of macroscopic pieces of the new phase, and that unless the phase transformation occurs near equilibrium, the classical-theory calculation of the work of cluster formation is incorrect. Close to equilibrium, a critical fluctuation of the new phase resembles the critical nucleus in classical nucleation theory (CNT) in various ways: (1) the order parameter (such as the density) at the center of the nucleus approaches the equilibrium value for the new phase, (2) the specific energy associated with the interface approaches that of a flat interface, (3) the size of the fluctuation (corresponding to the cluster radius) is very large, (4) the thickness of the interface is small compared with the size of the fluctuation, and (5) the work of formation for the fluctuation is in reasonable agreement with predictions from CNT.},

  abstract = {Phase-field modelling, as it is understood today, is still a young discipline in condensed matter physics, which established itself for that class of systems in condensed matter physics, which can be characterized by domains of different phases separated by a distinct interface. Driven out of equilibrium, their dynamics results in the evolution of those interfaces, during which those might develop into well-defined structures with characteristic length scales at the nano-, micro- or mesoscale. Since the material properties of such systems are, to a large extent, determined by those small-scale structures, acquiring a precise understanding of the mechanisms that drive the interfacial dynamics is a great challenge for scientists in this field. Phase-field modelling is an approach that allows us to tackle this challenge simulation-based. This overview summarizes briefly the essentials of the conceptual background of the phase-field method, as well as recent issues the phase-field community is focusing on, as far as they are related to nucleation. To that end a brief introduction to the basic understanding underlying the diffuse interface description, which is the conceptual backbone of phase-field modelling, is given at the beginning, followed by a detailed picture of its achievements so far in applications to nucleation phenomena in metals and colloids. Within the most relevant fields of condensed matter physics, approached by phase-field modelling until now, applications to metallic systems are a traditional domain of phase-field modelling and nucleation phenomena therein have been addressed by several groups. This paper provides an overview of these. Advances in the field of colloidal systems, on the other hand, are only more recent and are addressed here in the context of contributions to soft matter physics in general.},

This paper focuses on improving the performance of the phase-field model of which the vacancy concentration is used as the single conserved order parameter. Following recent developments in these phase-field models, the void dynamic, or more precisely the void growth rate which plays a vital role in characterizing the microstructural evolution of irradiated materials, cannot be accurately reproduced. Moreover, the interfacial energy or the void-matrix interface modeled by the Ginzburg-type gradient energy term is usually characterized by an empirical coefficient that is quite difficult to determine. For these reasons, a general relation of the bulk free energy density, the coefficient of the gradient energy term and the interface width is analytically derived from the planar interface case, and then validated by the numerical simulation example of a single void evolution in molybdenum (Mo). The obtained void growth rate agrees well with the prediction of rate theory while the interface width is smaller than a critical value in the considered cases regardless of the shape of the free energy density. This study will not only help to construct the appropriate formulation of the bulk free energy density, but will also provide an easy method of calculating the corresponding gradient energy coefficient and selecting the grid size according to the pre-estimated interface width.},

In the present work, we model the process of nucleation and growth using a combination of classical nucleation and phase-field theory. A diffusion coupled phase-field model is used to evaluate the work of formation and the growth behavior of the critical nucleus. The results are combined with classical nucleation and JMAK theory in order to estimate the glass forming ability of the compositions Cu64Zr36,Cu10Zr7 and CuZr2 in terms of TTT-diagrams and critical cooling rates. It is found that the work of formation of the critical nucleus from the phase-field theory agrees with the classical theory when the critical size is larger than the width of the solid-liquid interface. At smaller critical sizes, the work of formation deviates approximately linearly between the two theories. Furthermore, it is shown that the growth behavior from the phase-field simulations agree with analytical expressions of the growth rate from the classical theory.},

Besides simpler cases of homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation, phenomena addressed by these techniques include precursor assisted nucleation, nucleation in eutectic and phase separating systems, phase selection via competing nucleation processes, growth front nucleation (a process, in which grains of new orientations form at the solidification front) yielding crystal sheaves and spherulites, and transition between the growth controlled cellular and the nucleation dominated equiaxial solidification morphologies.},

The calculation of the interfacial energy and the nucleation barrier certainly depends on the proper definition of the solid-liquid dividing surface and the corresponding nucleus size. We define the position of the sharp interface at which the interfacial energy is to be evaluated by using the concept of equimolar dividing surface (re) and the minimization of the interfacial energy (rs). The comparison of the results based on both radii shows that the difference re−rs is always positive and has a limit for large cluster sizes which is comparable to the Tolman length. Furthermore, we found the real nucleation barrier for small cluster sizes, which is defined as a function of the radius rs, and compared it with the classical nucleation theory. The simulation results also show that the extracted interfacial energy as function of both radii is independent of system size, and this dependence can be reasonably described by the nonclassical Tolman formula with a positive Tolman length.},

We refine the phase diagram for 3D, and determine the line free energy in 2D and the height of the nucleation barrier in 2D and 3D for homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation by solving the respective Euler–Lagrange (EL) equations. We demonstrate that, in the PFC model, the body-centered cubic (bcc), the face-centered cubic (fcc), and the hexagonal close-packed structures (hcp) compete, while the simple cubic structure is unstable, and that phase preference can be tuned by changing the model parameters: close to the critical point the bcc structure is stable, while far from the critical point the fcc prevails, with an hcp stability domain in between. We note that with increasing distance from the critical point the equilibrium shapes vary from the sphere to specific faceted shapes: rhombic dodecahedron (bcc), truncated octahedron (fcc), and hexagonal prism (hcp). Solving the equation of motion of the PFC model supplied with conserved noise, solidification starts with the nucleation of an amorphous precursor phase, into which the stable crystalline phase nucleates. The growth rate is found to be time dependent and anisotropic; this anisotropy depends on the driving force. We show that due to the diffusion-controlled growth mechanism, which is especially relevant for crystal aggregation in colloidal systems, dendritic growth structures evolve in large-scale isothermal single-component PFC simulations. An oscillatory effective pair potential resembling those for model glass formers has been evaluated from structural data of the amorphous phase obtained by instantaneous quenching. Finally, we present results for eutectic solidification in a binary PFC model.},

This growth mode, termed GC (glass-crystal), is so fast that it is not limited by molecular diffusion in the bulk liquid. We have studied the GC mode by growing seven polymorphs from the liquid of ROY, currently the top system for the number of coexisting polymorphs of known structures. Some polymorphs did not show GC growth, while others did, with the latter having higher density and more isotropic molecular packing. The polymorphs not showing GC growth grew as compact spherulites at all temperatures; their growth rates near Tg decreased smoothly with falling temperature. The polymorphs showing GC growth changed growth morphologies with temperature, from faceted single crystals near the melting points, to fiber-like crystals near Tg, and to compact spherulites in the GC mode; in the GC mode, they grew at rates 3−4 orders of magnitude faster with activation energies 2-fold smaller than the polymorphs not showing GC growth. The GC mode had rates and activation energies similar to those of a polymorphic transformation observed near Tg. The GC mode was disrupted by the onset of the liquid's structural relaxation but could persist well above Tg (up to 1.15 Tg) in the form of fast-growing fibers. We consider various explanations for the GC mode and suggest that it is solid-state transformation enabled by local molecular motions native to the glassy state and disrupted by the liquid's structural relaxation (the α process).},

  abstract = {Complex networks describe a wide range of systems in nature and society. Frequently cited examples include the cell, a network of chemicals linked by chemical reactions, and the Internet, a network of routers and computers connected by physical links. While traditionally these systems have been modeled as random graphs, it is increasingly recognized that the topology and evolution of real networks are governed by robust organizing principles. This article reviews the recent advances in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks, the authors discuss the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks, the emerging theory of evolving networks, and the interplay between topology and the network’s robustness against failures and attacks.},

  abstract = {We have recently shown that 5\% CO2/95\% O2 in the serosal bathing solution, with 100\% O2 in the mucosal solution, results in CO2-diffusion limitation of acid secretion in bullfrog gastric mucosa. Changing to 10\% CO2/90\% 02 on both surfaces doubles the acid secretory rate. We calculate that, were the rate of oxygen consumption to increase significantly as a result of secretory stimulation, the tissue would now be oxygen limited. This prediction is tested by raising the P02 by increasing the total pressure in a hyperbaric chamber. Since no change in acid secretory rate or potential difference was observed upon changing from PO2 = 0.9 to PO2 = 1.9 atm, we conclude that the tissue is not O2 limited at normal pressure. Decreasing PO2 below 0.9 atm, by contrast, decreases the acid secretory rate and raises both PD and resistance. We infer that the rate of oxygen consumption did not rise significantly when acid secretion was increased by supplying sufficient CO2.},

Both unperturbed 2D films and films on a model graphite substrate are investigated; in the latter case the fluid parameters are chosen to model methane. Large systems are used, up to 8000 molecules in the case of the unperturbed 2D films. Finite-size effects are accounted for in the region near the critical point, and the critical temperatures and densities are estimated for both systems. For the unperturbed 2D LJ films we find the reduced critical temperature and density to be T*c = 0·498 ± 0·002, and ρ*c = 0·360 ± 0·005. The corresponding values for the monolayer film on graphite are T*c = 0·500 ± 0·002, and ρ*c = 0·368 ± 0·005. The influence of the graphite substrate on the coexistence curve is found to be small, as expected. Comparisons of the simulated coexistence curve with experimental data for methane on graphite show good agreement in the critical region, and for the coexisting liquid phase densities, but the simulated gas phase densities are smaller than experimental values.},

Experimental 1H and/or 13C NMR spectral data and its proper interpretation for the compound of interest is required as a starting point. The approach involves the following steps: (i) using molecular mechanics calculations (with, e.g., MacroModel) to generate a library of conformers; (ii) using density functional theory (DFT) calculations (with, e.g., Gaussian 09) to determine optimal geometry, free energies and chemical shifts for each conformer; (iii) determining Boltzmann-weighted proton and carbon chemical shifts; and (iv) comparing the computed chemical shifts for two or more candidate structures with experimental data to determine the best fit. For a typical structure assignment of a small organic molecule (e.g., fewer than ∼10 non-H atoms or up to ∼180 a.m.u. and ∼20 conformers), this protocol can be completed in ∼2 h of active effort over a 2-d period; for more complex molecules (e.g., fewer than ∼30 non-H atoms or up to ∼500 a.m.u. and ∼50 conformers), the protocol requires ∼3–6 h of active effort over a 2-week period. To demonstrate the method, we have chosen the analysis of the cis- versus the trans-diastereoisomers of 3-methylcyclohexanol (1-cis versus 1-trans). The protocol is written in a manner that makes the computation of chemical shifts tractable for chemists who may otherwise have only rudimentary computational experience.},

This identification and the location of the transition is in good agreement with that obtained from an analysis of the free energies of the fluid and solid phases. Equilibration problems are found in the solid phase and the melting of a defective solid is also investigated. The behavior of the pair distribution function, angular correlation function, diffusion constant, and the defect structure uncovered by an analysis of nearest-neighbor polygons is generally consistent with a first-order mechanism. Evidence for direct fluid-solid coexistence is presented. However, a very small fluid-solid interface tension is indicated, and there is a rapid growth in the range of correlations in the fluid near freezing. The behavior of the elastic constants at melting is in fairly good agreement with the Halperin-Nelson melting criterion.},

The repulsive part is treated "exactly" by Monte Carlo computations with a 864-atom system, and the attractive part is treated as a perturbation. The "unperturbed" potential, which is homogeneous in the coordinates of the interacting particles, has trivial scaling properties which greatly simplify the computations. The attractive perturbation is treated to first order; the second-order corrections are shown to be very small at not-too-low temperatures. A high-temperature equation of state is obtained for the Lennard-Jones fluid, which is in excellent agreement with exact Monte Carlo computations at temperatures as low as about twice the critical temperature. Using the Hoover-Ree scheme, the free energy of the solid is determined and the transition densities and pressures calculated in the first-order approximation, which is shown to be quite satisfactory. The validity of Lindemann's melting "law" and a crystallization criterion based on the maximum of the structure factor are investigated.},

  abstract = {There has recently been extensive interest in the nature of the melting/freezing transition for a two-dimensional system of molecules interacting with Lennard-Jones 6:12 potentials, which is a prototype for physisorbed systems. We have therefore made a detailed study of the thermodynamics of the phase diagram for this system. We first made calculations using liquid-state perturbation theory for the fluid state and a self-consistent cell theory for the solid state to determine thermodynamic functions; these results led to ordinary first-order phase transitions between solid/fluid and liquid/gas phases, in agreement with the constant-pressure Monte Carlo results of Abraham. We refined the calculations by using constant-pressure and constant-density Monte Carlo results to improve the accuracy of the calculated free energies, and we determined the two-phase equilibria by making direct Monte Carlo calculations for two-phase systems. The results are internally consistent and lead to a phase diagram qualitatively similar to the three-dimensional Lennard-Jones system.
Résumé
La nature de la transition fusion/solidification pour un système bidimensionel de molécules avec des interactions représentées par des potentiels Lennard-Jones 6:12, qui constitue un prototype des systèmes physisorbés, a suscité récemment beaucoup d'intérêt. C'est pourquoi nous avons fait une étude détaillée de la thermodynamique du diagramme des phases pour ce système. Nous avons d'abord fait des calculs, en utilisant la théorie des pertubations de l'état liquide dans le cas de l'état fluide, et une théorie cellulaire self-consistante dans le cas de l'état solide, pour déterminer les fonctions thermodynamiques; ces résultats ont conduit à des transitions de phase ordinaires du premier ordre entre les phases solide/fluide et liquide/gaz, en accord avec les résultats Monte Carlo à pression constante de Abraham. Nous avons raffiné les calculs en utilisant des résultats Monte Carlo à pression constante et à densité constante pour améliorer la précision des énergies libres calculées, et nous avons déterminé les équilibres à deux phases en faisant des calculs Monte Carlo directs pour les systèmes à deux phases. Les résultats sont cohérents et conduisent à un diagramme des phases qualitativement semblable à celui du système Lennard-Jones tridimensionnel.},

Even for the fundamental hard-disk model, the melting mechanism has not been agreed upon after 50 years of studies. A recent Monte Carlo algorithm allows us to thermalize systems large enough to access the thermodynamic regime. We show that melting in hard disks proceeds in two steps with a liquid phase, a hexatic phase, and a solid. The hexatic-solid transition is continuous while, surprisingly, the liquid-hexatic transition is of first order. This melting scenario solves one of the fundamental statistical-physics models, which is at the root of a large body of theoretical, computational, and experimental research.},

This has remained a formidable task, despite a plethora of existing clustering methods. We present InfleCS, a novel method for extracting well-defined core states from free energy landscapes. The method is based on a Gaussian mixture free energy estimator and exploits the shape of the estimated density landscape. The core states that naturally arise from the clustering allow for detailed characterization of the conformational ensemble. The clustering quality is evaluated on three toy models with different properties, where the method is shown to consistently outperform other conventional and state-of-the-art clustering methods. Finally, the method is applied to a temperature enhanced molecular dynamics simulation of Ca2+-bound Calmodulin. Through the free energy landscape, we discover a pathway between a canonical and a compact state, revealing conformational changes driven by electrostatic interactions.},

  abstract = {We have measured in situ Raman spectra of SiO2 glass between room temperature through the glass transformation range to the supercooled liquid at 1950 K, using a new wire loop heating technique. These results provide valuable insights into the structural and dynamic behaviour of this prototype silicate system at magmatic temperatures. The principal low frequency Raman band in the glass shows an anomalous increase in frequency with increasing temperature, indicating that the average SiOSi angle narrows as temperature is increased, due to anharmonic vibrational effects. Configurational changes at temperatures above Tg result in further increases in the band frequency. These effects are responsible for the anomalous volume behaviour of SiO2 glass and supercooled liquid with increasing temperature, including the low thermal expansivity over most of the temperature range, and the occurrence of density maxima at low and high temperatures. From experiments on glasses with different fictive temperatures, there is an increase in the intensity of the 606 cm−1 band, due to an increase in the proportion of three-membered ring “defect” species in the glass above Tg. This indicates that structural relaxation in the liquid state is accompanied by Si — O — Si bond breaking and reforming reactions, consistent with the measured magnitude of the activation energy for viscous flow. This observation is combined with recent results on the mechanism of structural relaxation in silicate liquids to propose an energetic model for viscous relaxation in SiO2, involving O2− transfer via formation of a vSi intermediate. This model is then generalized to ternary aluminosilicate systems, to provide a rationalization for the observed viscosity maximum at constant silica content, in high silica rock-forming melt compositions.},

  abstract = {We study thermodynamic and dynamic properties of a rigid model of the fragile glass-forming liquid orthoterphenyl. This model, introduced by Lewis and Wahnström in 1993, collapses each phenyl ring to a single interaction site; the intermolecular site-site interactions are described by the Lennard-Jones potential whose parameters have been selected to reproduce some bulk properties of the orthoterphenyl molecule. A system of N=343 molecules is considered in a wide range of densities and temperatures, reaching simulation times up to 1μs. Such long trajectories allow us to equilibrate the system at temperatures below the mode coupling temperature Tc at which the diffusion constant reaches values of order 10−10cm2/s and thereby to sample in a significant way the potential energy landscape in the entire temperature range. Working within the inherent structures thermodynamic formalism, we present results for the temperature and density dependence of the number, depth and shape of the basins of the potential energy surface. We evaluate the total entropy of the system by thermodynamic integration from the ideal—noninteracting—gas state and the vibrational entropy approximating the basin free energy with the free energy of 6N−3 harmonic oscillators. We evaluate the configurational part of the entropy as a difference between these two contributions. We study the connection between thermodynamical and dynamical properties of the system. We confirm that the temperature dependence of the configurational entropy and of the diffusion constant, as well as the inverse of the characteristic structural relaxation time, are strongly connected in supercooled states; we demonstrate that this connection is well represented by the Adam-Gibbs relation, stating a linear relation between logD and the quantity 1/TSc. This relation is found to hold both above and below the critical temperature Tc—as previously found in the case of silica—supporting the hypothesis that a connection exists between the number of basins and the connectivity properties of the potential energy surface.},

The molecule is described by a simple rigid three-site model, with interactions between different molecules of the Lennard-Jones form. We find that the long-time (α) relaxation, as determined from the intermediate scattering function, is well described by a Kohlrausch law. The zero-time amplitude of this process, often referred to as the ‘‘nonergodicity parameter,’’ which can be interpreted as a Debye-Waller factor, is seen to depart from a linear temperature dependence and seems to exhibit a ‘‘singularity’’ at a temperature substantially larger than the conventional glass transition temperature, in accord with neutron-scattering data, and as predicted by mode-coupling theory. We find that the observed anharmonic behavior around Tc, as well as the decay of the scattering functions, is equally evident from both orientational and translational correlations. The latter observation indicates that the structural changes that take place during α relaxation are neither specifically orientational nor specifically translational. Investigation of the van Hove self-correlation for both center-of-mass and orientational motion reveals the existence of a strong non-Gaussian spatial dependence at intermediate times and of processes, even at low temperatures, that cannot be described as simple vibrational motion, and which consist of rapid reorientations of the molecules about their essentially frozen centers of mass. This motion may be related to the fast secondary mode seen in experiments.},

  abstract = {Relaxation times and transport processes of many glass-forming supercooled liquids exhibit a super-Arrhenius temperature dependence. We examine this phenomenon by computer simulation of the Lewis-Wahnström model for ortho-terphenyl. We propose a microscopic definition for a single-molecule cage-breaking transition and show that, when correlation behaviour is taken into account, these rearrangements are sufficient to reproduce the correct translational diffusion constants over an intermediate temperature range in the supercooled regime. We show that super-Arrhenius behaviour can be attributed to increasing negative correlation in particle movement at lower temperatures and relate this to the cage-breaking description. Finally, we sample the potential energy landscape of the model and show that it displays hierarchical ordering. Substructures in the landscape, which may correspond to metabasins, have boundaries defined by cage-breaking transitions. The cage-breaking formulation provides a direct link between the potential energy landscape and macroscopic diffusion behaviour.},

By examining trends with θ0, comparing these to the trends in trimers’ jamming phenomenology, and then focusing on the six θ0 that are commensurable with close-packed crystalline order, we obtain three key results: (i) the increase in trimers’ solidification temperature Ts(θ0) as they straighten (as θ0 → 0°) is driven by the same gradual loss of effective configurational freedom that drives athermal trimers’ decreasing ϕJ(θ0) [where ϕJ(θ0) is the packing fraction at jamming]; (ii) θ0 that allow formation of both FCC and HCP order crystallize, while θ0 that only allow formation of HCP order glass-form; and (iii) local cluster-level structure at temperatures slightly above Ts(θ0) is highly predictive of whether trimers will crystallize or glass-form.},

  abstract = {Dynamic relaxation is an intrinsic and universal feature of glasses and enables fluctuation and dissipation to occur, which induces plentiful behaviour, maintains equilibrium, and achieves evolution in glass systems. Relaxation covers a broad time, frequency, and temperature ranges and determines the functions, behaviour, properties and applications of glassy system. Investigations of dynamic relaxation are significant for understanding the nature of glasses, liquids, and the critical issues of glass formation and transition, dynamic and structural heterogeneities, flow behaviour and flow units, various crossover temperatures, deformations, aging and rejuvenation, stability, crystallization, and the mechanical and physical properties of glasses. Metallic glasses (MGs) with unique microstructure and mechanical and functional properties, offer a simple but effective system for study of relaxation and related issues in glass science. In this review, a panoramic view of the state of the art of various aspects of dynamic relaxation in metallic glassy system, as well as a comparison with other glassy systems, is presented. The features and mechanisms of each known relaxation mode including primary α-relaxation, slow and fast 7 β-relaxations, nearly constant loss, and boson peak, as well as their coupling in MGs, are reviewed and summarized. Emphasis is presented to the microstructural origin of these dynamic relaxation modes and their connection with the dynamic and structural heterogeneities in MGs. The factors which determine and affect the relaxation modes and behaviour in low-dimensional MGs are also introduced. It is shown that the relaxation in MGs is connected with their structural characteristics, heterogeneity, formation, glass transition, flow behaviour, physical and mechanical properties, crystallization, stability, and the localized atomic diffusion. The roles and the importance of dynamic relaxation in understanding many crucial issues in glassy physics are demonstrated. The correlations between dynamic relaxation and various properties of MGs are established and summarized. With this review on dynamic relaxation in metallic glasses, relaxation in MG can provide an effective perspective for understanding nearly all issues in metallic glasses. It is demonstrated that the relationship of relaxation to various properties, similar to the relationship of structure–property of crystalline materials, can be applied to control and design of new glassy materials with multiple functionalities, superior mechanical performance, and other extraordinary physical and chemical properties. Finally, the key unsolved questions regarding dynamic relaxation in metallic glasses are listed, and several emerging research directions in this still-evolving field are highlighted for future investigations.},

  abstract = {Jammed particulate systems composed of various shapes of particles undergo the jamming transition as they are compressed or decompressed. To date, sphere packings have been extensively studied in many previous works, where isostaticity at the transition and scaling laws with the pressure of various quantities, including the contact number and the vibrational density of states, have been established. Additionally, much attention has been paid to nonspherical packings, and particularly recent work has made progress in understanding ellipsoidal packings. In this work, we study the dimer packings in two dimensions, which have been much less understood than systems of spheres and ellipsoids. We first study the contact number of dimers near the jamming transition. It turns out that packings of dimers have “rotational rattlers,” each of which still has a free rotational motion. After correcting this effect, we show that dimers become isostatic at the jamming, and the excess contact number obeys the same critical law and finite-size scaling law as those of spheres. We next study the vibrational properties of dimers near the transition. We find that the vibrational density of states of dimers exhibits two characteristic plateaus that are separated by a peak. The high-frequency plateau is dominated by the translational degree of freedom, while the low-frequency plateau is dominated by the rotational degree of freedom. We establish the critical scaling laws of the characteristic frequencies of the plateaus and the peak near the transition. In addition, we present detailed characterizations of the real space displacement fields of vibrational modes in the translational and rotational plateaus.},

  abstract = {The glass transition – an apparent amorphous solidification process – is a central feature of the physical properties of soft materials such as polymers and colloids. A key element of this phenomenon is the observation of a broad spectrum of deviations from an Arrhenius temperature of dynamics in glass-forming liquids, with the extent of deviation quantified by the “fragility” of glass formation. The underlying origin of “fragile” glass formation and its dependence on molecular structure remain major open questions in condensed matter physics and soft materials science. Here we employ molecular dynamics simulations, together with a neural-network-biased genetic algorithm, to design and study model rigid molecules spanning a broad range of fragilities of glass formation. Results indicate that fragility of glass formation can be controlled by tuning molecular asphericity, with extended molecules tending to exhibit low fragilities and compact molecules tending toward higher fragilities. The glass transition temperature itself, on the other hand, correlates well with high-temperature activation behavior and with density. These results point the way towards rational design of glass-forming liquids spanning a range of dynamical behavior, both via these physical insights and via future extensions of this evolutionary design strategy to real chemistries. Finally, we show that results compare well with predictions of the nonlinear Langevin theory of liquid dynamics, which is a precursor of the more recently developed elastically collective nonlinear Langevin equation theory of Mirigian and Schweizer, identifying this framework as a promising basis for molecular design of the glass transition.},

Previous work, however, has consisted of either proof-of-concept implementations of components, usually the range-limited force; full systems, but with much of the work shared by the host CPU; or prototype demonstrations, e.g., using OpenCL, that neither implement a whole system nor have competitive performance. In this paper, we present what we believe to be the first full-scale FPGA-based simulation engine, and show that its performance is competitive with a GPU (running Amber in an industrial production environment). The system features on-chip particle data storage and management, short- and long-range force evaluation, as well as bonded forces, motion update, and particle migration. Other contributions of this work include exploring numerous architectural trade-offs and analysis on various mappings schemes among particles/cells and the various on-chip compute units. The potential impact is that this system promises to be the basis for long timescale Molecular Dynamics with a commodity cluster.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulation (MD) is one of the most important applications in computational science and engineering. Despite its widespread use, there exists a many order-of-magnitude gap between the demand and the performance currently achieved. Acceleration of MD has therefore received much attention. In this chapter, we discuss the progress made in accelerating MD using Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). We first introduce the algorithms and computational methods used in MD and describe the general issues in accelerating MD. In the core of this chapter, we show how to design an efficient force computation pipeline for the range-limited force computation, the most time-consuming part of MD and the most mature topic in FPGA acceleration of MD. We discuss computational techniques and simulation quality and present efficient filtering and mapping schemes. We also discuss overall design, host–accelerator interaction and other board-level issues. We conclude with future challenges and the potential of production FPGA-accelerated MD.},

  abstract = {The breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation between diffusivity and viscosity at low temperatures is considered to be one of the hallmarks of glassy dynamics in liquids. Theoretical analyses relate this breakdown with the presence of heterogeneous dynamics, and by extension, with the fragility of glass formers. We perform an investigation of the breakdown of the SE relation in 2, 3, and 4 dimensions in order to understand these interrelations. Results from simulations of model glass formers show that the degree of the breakdown of the SE relation decreases with increasing spatial dimensionality. The breakdown itself can be rationalized via the difference between the activation free energies for diffusivity and viscosity (or relaxation times) in the Adam-Gibbs relation in three and four dimensions. The behavior in two dimensions also can be understood in terms of a generalized Adam-Gibbs relation that is observed in previous work. We calculate various measures of heterogeneity of dynamics and find that the degree of the SE breakdown and measures of heterogeneity of dynamics are generally well correlated but with some exceptions. The two-dimensional systems we study show deviations from the pattern of behavior of the three- and four-dimensional systems both at high and low temperatures. The fragility of the studied liquids is found to increase with spatial dimensionality, contrary to the expectation based on the association of fragility with heterogeneous dynamics.},

With ultrahigh static field gradients up to ≈ 180 T/m, a prototype of which has recently been installed in Mainz, Q-values up to {$>$} 10−2 Å−1 become accessible. The first part of the paper focusses on details of this technical development and points out the close analogy with incoherent neutron scattering. In the second part, the enormous new possibilities of this kind of gradient NMR are demonstrated through a collection of most recent applications: the measurement of small self-diffusion coefficients down to about 10−15 m2s−1 in supercooled liquids and in molecular crystals, long chain polymer dynamics, restricted diffusion in systems of confined mesocopic geometries and anomalous diffusion on fractal structures.},

Rotational correlation times from 10-10 to 103 s were measured in the temperature range from 341 to 515 K (Tg = 343.5 K). Translational diffusion coefficients ranged from 10-6 to 10-15 cm2/s over a similar temperature range. The rotational correlation times of all probes have essentially the same temperature dependence as the viscosity of TNB. In contrast, the translational diffusion of the smallest probe, tetracene, is observed to have a significantly weaker temperature dependence. At Tg, the translational diffusion coefficient of tetracene is 300 times larger than expected based on its rotational correlation time. Similar enhancements of translational diffusion near Tg have recently been observed in other glass-forming liquids. These observations suggest that dynamics in TNB and other supercooled liquids are spatially heterogeneous. The probes used in this study were tetracene, rubrene, 9,10-diphenylanthracene, and 9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene.},

  abstract = {The empirical dielectric decay function γ(t)= exp –(t/τ0)β may be transformed analytically to give the frequency dependent complex dielectric constant if β is chosen to be 0.50. The resulting dielectric constant and dielectric loss curves are non-symmetrical about the logarithm of the frequency of maximum loss, and are intermediate between the Cole-Cole and Davidson-Cole empirical relations. Using a short extrapolation procedure, good agreement is obtained between the empirical representation and the experimental curves for the α relaxation in polyethyl acrylate. It is suggested that the present representation would have a general application to the α relaxations in other polymers. The Hamon approximation, with a small applied correction, is valid for the present function with β= 0.50 in the range log(ωτ0) {$>$} –0.5, but cannot be used at lower frequencies.},

Two different regimes of viscous behavior are found in the time window accessible in MD simulation studies (of the order of nanoseconds if units appropriate for argon are used). The results for the time dependence of the self-intermediate scattering function Fs(q,t) show two different slow relaxation processes, where the slowest (α relaxation) can be represented by a stretched exponential, exp[-(t/τrel)β]. In the frequency domain this gives rise to a quasielastic peak, and it is found that its area, the nonergodicity parameter fs(q)==a, shows an anomalous decrease when increasing the temperature towards a critical value Tc. This happens in the supercooled-liquid regime, and it is one of the basic predictions of the recent mode-coupling theory for the liquid-glass transition problem. In the strongly supercooled-liquid regime the diffusion is of the hopping type, and it is found to be strongly cooperative in nature.},

The pair-correlation function and the constant of self-diffusion are found to agree well with experiment; the latter is 15\% lower than the experimental value. The spectrum of the velocity autocorrelation function shows a broad maximum in the frequency region ω=0.25(kBTℏ). The shape of the Van Hove function Gs(r, t) attains a maximum departure from a Gaussian at about t=3.0×10−12 sec and becomes a Gaussian again at about 10−11 sec. The Van Hove function Gd(r, t) has been compared with the convolution approximation of Vineyard, showing that this approximation gives a too rapid decay of Gd(r, t) with time. A delayed-convolution approximation has been suggested which gives a better fit with Gd(r, t); this delayed convolution makes Gd(r, t) decay as t4 at short times and as t at long times.},

Single molecule orientational correlation times show this strong Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann temperature dependence typical for glasses. Through statistical analysis of single molecule trajectories, we can identify individual glass rearrangement events in the vicinity of a probe molecule in the glass former poly(vinyl acetate) from 8 K below to 6 K above the glass transition temperature. We find that changes in the distribution of waiting times between individual glass rearrangement events are much less dramatic with temperature, the main difference being a small, but decisive number of increasingly long waiting times at lower temperatures. We notice similar individual, local relaxation events in molecular dynamics trajectories for a variety of glassy systems further from the glass transition, leading to waiting time distributions with similar features as those observed in the single molecule experiments. We show that these rare long waiting times are responsible for the dramatic increase in correlation time upon cooling.},

  abstract = {In V-T theory the atomic motion is harmonic vibrations in a liquid-specific potential energy valley, plus transits, which move the system rapidly among the multitude of such valleys. In its first application to the self intermediate scattering function (SISF), V-T theory produced an accurate account of molecular dynamics (MD) data at all wave numbers q and time t. Recently, analysis of the mean square displacement (MSD) resolved a crossover behavior that was not observed in the SISF study. Our purpose here is to apply the more accurate MSD calibration to the SISF, and assess the results. We derive and discuss the theoretical equations for vibrational and transit contributions to the SISF. The time evolution is divided into three successive intervals: the vibrational interval when the vibrational contribution alone accurately accounts for the MD data; the crossover when the vibrational contribution saturates and the transit contribution becomes resolved; and the diffusive interval when the transit contribution alone accurately accounts for the MD data. The resulting theoretical error is extremely small at all q and t. V-T theory is compared to mode-coupling theories for the MSD and SISF, and to recent developments in Brownian motion experiments and theory.},

  abstract = {We study the dynamical behaviour of a computer model for viscous silica, the archetypal strong glass former, and compare its diffusion mechanism with earlier studies of a fragile binary Lennard-Jones liquid. Three different methods of analysis are employed. First, the temperature and time scale dependence of the diffusion constant is analysed. Negative correlation of particle displacements influences transport properties in silica as well as in fragile liquids. We suggest that the difference between Arrhenius and super-Arrhenius diffusive behaviour results from competition between the correlation time scale and the caging time scale. Second, we analyse the dynamics using a geometrical definition of cage-breaking transitions that was proposed previously for fragile glass formers. We find that this definition accurately captures the bond rearrangement mechanisms that control transport in open network liquids, and reproduces the diffusion constants accurately at low temperatures. As the same method is applicable to both strong and fragile glass formers, we can compare correlation time scales in these two types of systems. We compare the time spent in chains of correlated cage breaks with the characteristic caging time and find that correlations in the fragile binary Lennard-Jones system persist for an order of magnitude longer than those in the strong silica system. We investigate the origin of the correlation behaviour by sampling the potential energy landscape for silica and comparing it with the binary Lennard-Jones model. We find no qualitative difference between the landscapes, but several metrics suggest that the landscape of the fragile liquid is rougher and more frustrated. Metabasins in silica are smaller than those in binary Lennard-Jones and contain fewer high-barrier processes. This difference probably leads to the observed separation of correlation and caging time scales.},

Treating the high dimensionality of molecular and condensed matter systems of contemporary interest is important for understanding how emergent properties are encoded in the landscape and for calculating these properties while faithfully representing barriers between different morphologies. The pathways characterized in full dimensionality, which are used to construct kinetic transition networks, may prove useful in guiding such calculations. The energy landscape perspective has also produced new procedures for structure prediction and analysis of thermodynamic properties. Basin-hopping global optimization, with alternative acceptance criteria and generalizations to multiple metric spaces, has been used to treat systems ranging from biomolecules to nanoalloy clusters and condensed matter. This review also illustrates how all this methodology, developed in the context of chemical physics, can be transferred to landscapes defined by cost functions associated with machine learning.},

  abstract = {.From equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a bead-spring model for short-chain glass-forming polymer melts we calculate several quantities characterizing the single-monomer dynamics near the (extrapolated) critical temperature 𝑇cTcT\_\{\textbackslash{}rm c\} of mode-coupling theory: the mean-square displacement g0(t), the non-Gaussian parameter 𝛼2(𝑡)α2(t) \textbackslash{}alpha\_\{2\}(t) and the self-part of the van Hove function 𝐺s(𝑟,𝑡)Gs(r,t) G\_\{\textbackslash{}rm s\}(r,t) which measures the distribution of monomer displacements r in time t. We also determine these quantities from a continuous-time random walk (CTRW) approach. The CTRW is defined in terms of various probability distributions which we know from previous analysis. Utilizing these distributions the CTRW can be solved numerically and compared to the MD data with no adjustable parameter. The MD results reveal the heterogeneous and non-Gaussian single-particle dynamics of the supercooled melt near 𝑇cTc T\_\{\textbackslash{}rm c\}. In the time window of the early 𝛼α\textbackslash{}alpha relaxation 𝛼2(𝑡)α2(t) \textbackslash{}alpha\_\{2\}(t) is large and 𝐺s(𝑟,𝑡)Gs(r,t) G\_\{\textbackslash{}rm s\}(r,t) is broad, reflecting the coexistence of monomer displacements that are much smaller (“slow particles”) and much larger (“fast particles”) than the average at time t, i.e. than 𝑟=𝑔0(𝑡)1/2r=g0(t)1/2 r = g\_\{0\}(t)\^\{1/2\}. For large r the tail of 𝐺s(𝑟,𝑡)Gs(r,t) G\_\{\textbackslash{}rm s\}(r,t) is compatible with an exponential decay, as found for many glassy systems. The CTRW can reproduce the spatiotemporal dependence of 𝐺s(𝑟,𝑡)Gs(r,t) G\_\{\textbackslash{}rm s\}(r,t) at a qualitative to semiquantitative level. However, it is not quantitatively accurate in the studied temperature regime, although the agreement with the MD data improves upon cooling. In the early 𝛼α\textbackslash{}alpha regime we also analyze the MD results for 𝐺s(𝑟,𝑡)Gs(r,t) G\_\{\textbackslash{}rm s\}(r,t) via the space-time factorization theorem predicted by ideal mode-coupling theory. While we find the factorization to be well satisfied for small r, both above and below 𝑇cTc T\_\{\textbackslash{}rm c\} , deviations occur for larger r comprising the tail of 𝐺s(𝑟,𝑡)Gs(r,t) G\_\{\textbackslash{}rm s\}(r,t). The CTRW analysis suggests that single-particle “hops” are a contributing factor for these deviations.Graphical abstract Open image in new window},

  abstract = {Key to resolving the scientific challenge of the glass transition is to understand the origin of the massive increase in viscosity of liquids cooled below their melting temperature (avoiding crystallisation). A number of competing and often mutually exclusive theoretical approaches have been advanced to describe this phenomenon. Some posit a bona fide thermodynamic phase to an ‘ideal glass’, an amorphous state with exceptionally low entropy. Other approaches are built around the concept of the glass transition as a primarily dynamic phenomenon. These fundamentally different interpretations give equally good descriptions of the data available, so it is hard to determine which—if any—is correct. Recently however this situation has begun to change. A consensus has emerged that one powerful means to resolve this longstanding question is to approach the putative thermodynamic transition sufficiently closely, and a number of techniques have emerged to meet this challenge. Here we review the results of some of these new techniques and discuss the implications for the existence—or otherwise—of the thermodynamic transition to an ideal glass.},

The topology of the network of states formed is analyzed by employing graph-theoretical concepts. It is found that the network of the inherent structures visited by the system in the course of physical aging has both a scale-free and a small-world character. There exist minima acting as highly connected hubs in the network and trench-like sequences of states driving the system from one hub to another. In contrast to previous studies of scale-free networks in other branches of science, where the topology results from the static connectivity of the network's entities, this network is created by adding one-by-one the inherent structures traversed by the system during its evolution in time.},

We classify the structural similarity of different energy minima using a measure of overlap. This analysis reveals a correspondence between distinct particle packings (which are characterised via the overlap) and funnels on the energy landscape (which are characterised via disconnectivity graphs). As the number of pinned particles is increased, we find a crossover from glassy behavior at low pinning to a structure-seeking landscape at high pinning, in which all thermally accessible minima are structurally similar. We discuss the consequences of these results for theories of randomly pinned liquids. We also investigate how the energy landscape depends on the fraction of pinned particles, including the degree of frustration and the evolution of distinct packings as the number of pinned particles is reduced.},

  abstract = {We study the relation of the potential energy landscape (PEL) topography to relaxation dynamics of a small model glass former of Lennard-Jones type. The mechanism under investigation is the hopping between superstructures of PEL minima, called metabasins (MBs). Guided by the idea that the mean durations 〈τ〉 of visits to MBs should reflect the local PEL structure, we first derive the effective depths of MBs from dynamics, by the relation Eapp=dln⟨τ⟩/dβ, where β=1/kBT. Second, we establish a connection of Eapp to the barriers that surround MBs. As the consequence of a rugged PEL, it turns out that escapes from MBs do not happen by single hops between PEL minima, but correspond to complicated multiminima sequences. We introduce the concept of return probabilities to the bottom of the MBs in order to judge when the attraction range of a MB has been left. The energy barriers overcome can then be identified. These turn out to be in good agreement with the effective depths Eapp, calculated from dynamics. We are thus able to relate MB lifetimes to their local structure. Moreover, we can trace back the overall diffusive dynamics to the population of MBs and to their local topology, i.e., to purely thermodynamic and structural quantities. Single energy barriers are identified with the help of a new method, which accurately performs a descent along the ridge between two minima. We analyze the population of transition regions between minima, called basin borders. No indication for the mechanism of diffusion to change around the mode-coupling temperature can be found. We discuss the question whether the one-dimensional reaction paths connecting two minima are relevant for the calculation of reaction rates at the temperatures under study.},

Here we examine the barriers and cage-breaking rearrangements that are pertinent to long-term diffusion. Single-step cage-breaking processes, which follow high-barrier routes, are identified, and different methods and criteria for defining a cage-breaking process are considered. We examine the extent to which a description of cage-breaking within the energy landscape is a description of long-term diffusion. This description includes the identification of cage-breaks that are reversed, and those that are productive towards long-term diffusion. At low temperatures, diffusion is adequately described by productive cage-breaks, or by considering all cage-breaks and accounting for the effect of reversals. To estimate the diffusion constant we require only the mean square displacement of a cage-break, the average waiting time for a cage-break, and a measure of the number of reversed cage-breaks. Cage-breaks can be visualized within the potential energy landscape using disconnectivity graphs, and we compare the use of productive cage-breaks with previous definitions of “megabasins” or “metabasins.”},

NAMD scales to hundreds of processors on high-end parallel platforms, as well as tens of processors on low-cost commodity clusters, and also runs on individual desktop and laptop computers. NAMD works with AMBER and CHARMM potential functions, parameters, and file formats. This article, directed to novices as well as experts, first introduces concepts and methods used in the NAMD program, describing the classical molecular dynamics force field, equations of motion, and integration methods along with the efficient electrostatics evaluation algorithms employed and temperature and pressure controls used. Features for steering the simulation across barriers and for calculating both alchemical and conformational free energy differences are presented. The motivations for and a roadmap to the internal design of NAMD, implemented in C++ and based on Charm++ parallel objects, are outlined. The factors affecting the serial and parallel performance of a simulation are discussed. Finally, typical NAMD use is illustrated with representative applications to a small, a medium, and a large biomolecular system, highlighting particular features of NAMD, for example, the Tcl scripting language. The article also provides a list of the key features of NAMD and discusses the benefits of combining NAMD with the molecular graphics/sequence analysis software VMD and the grid computing/collaboratory software BioCoRE.

We briefly discuss three different precision models developed specifically for this work (SPDP, SPFP, and DPDP) and highlight the technical details of the approach as it extends beyond previously reported work [Götz et al., J.

By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations.

The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step.},

The method uses a rigid body trajectory of the molecule under consideration, which is constructed a posteriori by an accumulation of quaternion-based superposition fits of consecutive conformations. From the rigid body trajectory, we compute the translational and angular velocities of the molecule and by integration of the latter also the corresponding angular trajectory. All quantities can be referred to the laboratory frame and a molecule-fixed frame. The 6 × 6 diffusion tensor is computed from the asymptotic slope of the tensorial mean square displacement and, for comparison, also from the Kubo integral of the velocity correlation tensor. The method is illustrated for two simple model systems – a water molecule and a lysozyme molecule in bulk water. We give estimations of the statistical accuracy of the calculations.},

Translational diffusion of these molecules is found to be strongly coupled to their own rotational dynamics which, in turn, are coupled to similar motions of the surrounding water. In particular, we find that coupled orientational jump motions play an important role in all three cases. While CO and NO show similar features, CN− exhibits certain differences. Our results agree well with the known experimental values of the diffusion coefficient. We examined the validity of hydrodynamic predictions and found them to be inadequate, particularly for rotational diffusion.

Dielectric relaxation and solvation dynamic data are compared along the lines of the mean spherical approximation theory for discriminating between homogeneous and heterogeneous nature of dispersion for a low molecular weight glass at 3 K above the glass transition temperature, TG. From the theoretical point of view, the necessary spatial component stems from the dependence of solvation dynamics on ϵ(ω, κ), rather than the macroscopic limit ϵ(ω, κ = 0). It is shown that the two origins of dispersion can be distinguished in terms of solvation data which agree with the homogeneous limit.},

Central to the stability of the granules is the capillary force arising from the interfacial tension between solvent and air. This force appears capable of maintaining a granule in a jammed solid state, under conditions where the same amount of solvent and colloid could also exist as a flowable droplet. We argue that in the early stages of granulation the physics of dilatancy, which requires that a powder expand on shearing, is converted by capillary forces into the physics of arrest. Using a schematic model of colloidal arrest under stress, we speculate upon various jamming and granulation scenarios. Some preliminary experimental results on aspects of granulation in hard-sphere colloidal suspensions are also presented.},

  abstract = {When a system jams, it undergoes a transition from a flowing to a rigid state. Despite this important change in the dynamics, the internal structure of the system remains disordered in the solid as well as the fluid phase. In this way jamming is quite different from crystallization, the other common way in which a fluid solidifies. Jamming is a paradigm for thinking about how many different types of fluids—from molecular liquids to macroscopic granular matter—develop rigidity. Here we review recent work on the jamming transition. We start with perhaps the simplest model: frictionless spheres interacting via repulsive finite-range forces at zero temperature. In this highly idealized case, the transition has aspects of both first- and second-order transitions. From studies of the normal modes of vibration for the marginally jammed solid, new physics has emerged for how a material can be rigid without having the elastic properties of a normal solid. We first survey the simulation data and theoretical arguments that have been proposed to understand this behavior. We then review work that has systematically gone beyond the ideal model to see whether the scenario developed there is more generally applicable. This includes work that examines the effect of nonspherical particles, friction, and temperature on the excitations and the dynamics. We briefly touch on recent laboratory experiments that have begun to make contact with simulations and theory.},

  abstract = {Understanding the characteristics of jammed particle packings provides basic insights into the structure and bulk properties of crystals, glasses, and granular media and into selected aspects of biological systems. This review describes the diversity of jammed configurations attainable by frictionless convex nonoverlapping (hard) particles in Euclidean spaces and for that purpose it stresses individual-packing geometric analysis. A fundamental feature of that diversity is the necessity to classify individual jammed configurations according to whether they are locally, collectively, or strictly jammed. Each of these categories contains a multitude of jammed configurations spanning a wide and (in the large system limit) continuous range of intensive properties, including packing fraction ϕ, mean contact number Z, and several scalar order metrics. Application of these analytical tools to spheres in three dimensions (an analog to the venerable Ising model) covers a myriad of jammed states, including maximally dense packings (as Kepler conjectured), low-density strictly jammed tunneled crystals, and a substantial family of amorphous packings. With respect to the last of these, the current approach displaces the historically prominent but ambiguous idea of “random close packing” with the precise concept of “maximally random jamming.” Both laboratory procedures and numerical simulation protocols can and, frequently, have been used for creation of ensembles of jammed states. But while the resulting distributions of intensive properties may individually approach narrow distributions in the large system limit, the distinguishing varieties of possible operational details in these procedures and protocols lead to substantial variability among the resulting distributions, some examples of which are presented here. This review also covers recent advances in understanding jammed packings of polydisperse sphere mixtures, as well as convex nonspherical particles, e.g., ellipsoids, “superballs,” and polyhedra. Because of their relevance to error-correcting codes and information theory, sphere packings in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces have been included as well. Some remarks are also made about packings in (curved) non-Euclidean spaces. In closing this review, several basic open questions for future research to consider have been identified.},

Here we review the current understanding of the transition to jamming and the nature of the jammed state for disordered packings of particles that act through repulsive contact interactions and are at zero temperature and zero shear stress. We first discuss the breakdown of affine assumptions that underlies the rich mechanics near jamming. We then extensively discuss jamming of frictionless soft spheres. At the jamming point, these systems are marginally stable (isostatic) in the sense of constraint counting, and many geometric and mechanical properties scale with distance to this jamming point. Finally we discuss current explorations of jamming of frictional and non-spherical (ellipsoidal) particles. Both friction and asphericity tune the contact number at jamming away from the isostatic limit, but in opposite directions. This allows one to disentangle distance to jamming and distance to isostaticity. The picture that emerges is that most quantities are governed by the contact number and scale with distance to isostaticity, while the contact number itself scales with distance to jamming.},

I suppose that most of us, talking about supercooling a couple of years ago, would have divided substances into two classes, one with simple crystal structures like gold, and all the other ‘good’ metals on the one hand, and those with complex crystal structures, such as glycerol and the silicates on the other; saying that whereas the latter class can be very much supercooled, and will form glasses, the former class can only be supercooled a very few degrees. Then we would have added that there are some ‘ bad ’ metals, with moderately complex crystal structures, such as antimony or bismuth, which can be supercooled some tens of degrees, forming an intermediate class. I think we would then have added that this is quite comprehensible. In particular, that the X-ray diffraction patterns of the monatomic liquids show us that most of the atoms have the right numbers of nearest neighbours in a first co-ordination shell, all ready in place to start the growth of a crystal; which readily explains why these substances cannot be supercooled very much—a nice simple experimental fact, with a straightforward theoretical interpretation—and both are wrong.},

For square tracers dissimilar in structure to the local media structure of 2D colloids, the translation-rotation decoupling occurs and the rotational diffusion is enhanced relative to the translation. For sufficiently large diamond tracers similar in structure to the local media structure, tracers undergo rotational hopping motions and their rotation is suppressed relative to the translation. For distorted-diamond tracers, the decoupling is marginal. Translational diffusion does not change significantly with the tracer shape and obeys the Stokes-Einstein relation.},

An Einstein formulation of rotational motion is presented, which supplements the commonly used Debye model. The latter is shown to break down at supercooled temperatures as the mechanism of molecular reorientation changes from small random steps to large infrequent orientational jumps. We find that the model system exhibits non-Gaussian behavior in translational and rotational motion, which strengthens upon supercooling. Examination of particle mobility reveals spatially heterogeneous dynamics in translation and rotation, with a strong spatial correlation between translationally and rotationally mobile particles. Application of the Einstein formalism to the analysis of translation-rotation decoupling results in a trend opposite to that seen in conventional approaches based on the Debye formalism, namely, an enhancement in the effective rate of rotational motion relative to translation upon supercooling.},
