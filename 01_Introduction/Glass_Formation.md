# Glass Formation

## Avoiding the Crystal

Now we have learnt about nucleation and growth,
we know how to avoid it.

## Intrinsic Properties of the Glass

- Increasing rate of change of viscosity
- Strong/Fragile

Heat Capacity

- related to the degrees of freedom

No structural changes

- instead we need to look towards the dynamics
