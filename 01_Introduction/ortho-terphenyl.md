# Understanding ortho-terphenyl

## Experimental understanding

- excellent glass former
- experimentally interesting
- experiments only provide so much insight

## Modelling ortho-terphenyl

Lewis-Wahnstr√∂m [@Wanstrom1993]
Molecular-LJ
Molecular potentials

Computational complexity

- glass formation is a long timescale phenomenon
- state of the art is reaching ms times
- glasses are on the order of 1000s

## What makes OTP such a good glassformer

The question we are really asking is why is crystallisation so slow?

Factors inhibiting crystal growth

- Crystal with low potential energy saving
- interface
- competition from competing structures
- jamming

Just like @Griffith2018 initially developed an idea in 2D
before moving to 3D.[@Griffith2019]

## Computational Tractability in 2D

- Finite size effects
    - issues with previous simulations
    - need fewer particles in 2D
- Visualisation
    - 2D page, so 2D is simpler
- Method used previously for understanding glass formation [@Hurley1995]
