# Machine Learning

The field of machine learning,
also known as Artificial Intelligence
is full of amazing promises.
However between the large ideas
there are excellent tools which can help us perform science

## Decision Making

- liquid vs crystal
- Single valued order parameter
    - hexatic

- At some point a decision is made,
    - what values are liquid and what values are crystalline?
    - is this the best choice?
        - for the current configuration
        - for all conditions

- Formalism for making the best decision
    based on labelled data available.

- Use of machine learning for crystal detection
- Other uses within chemistry
