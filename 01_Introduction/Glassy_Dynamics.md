# Glassy Dynamics

Dynamics are important to both Crystal Growth, as a rate term
and to understanding the Glass.

## Introduction to Dynamics

Connecting viscosity using Stokes--Einstein and Stokes--Einstein--Debye

### Structural Relaxation

- Short timescale
- local "cage"
- measured in simulations and experiments

### Diffusion Constant

- long timescale motion
- derived from Brownian motion
- measured in both simulations and experiments

### Rotational (Dipole) Relaxation

- Relaxation of the orientation of a dipole
- measured in simulations and experiments

## Dynamic Heterogeneities

- Onset near the glass transition temperature
- large difference between mobile and immobile
- Simulations and experiments
- A feature of a fragile glass former

## Breakdown in rotational coupling

- no longer a single governing force
- Supercooled liquids approaching the glass transition temperature
    break our understanding of how liquids should behave.
