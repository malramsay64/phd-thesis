# Results

## Stability of Crystal Phases

- Melting behaviour of all phases
    - This would be looking at the phase changes that take place
    - Solid state phase transition


## Melting Rates

- The p2 crystal is demonstrated to be the most stable in the above simulations

- Change in volume over time

- Melting rates including errors

- Rotational relaxation times

- Normalised by the rotational relaxation time
