# Conclusion

In modelling the crystal growth behaviour of the Trimer
using range of models,
we have seen insights into why the crystal melting is so slow.
The lack of any observable growth
has significantly complicated this analysis,
primarily in the estimation of the melting point.

The semi-empirical density functional model of crystal melting
is the best descriptor for the melting of the Trimer molecule.
This removes the classical idea of molecules
regularly attaching and detaching from the surface,
instead describing that rate by
the fluctuations within the liquid and crystal.
This gives a single description of melting
for both pressures.
