# Conclusion

The melting of the Trimer molecule is incredibly slow,
even when accounting for the slow dynamics.
This slow dynamics can be attributed to the stiff liquid and crystal forms
which prevent a wide range of structures.
It is entirely possible the onset of dynamic heterogeneities
plays a role in this structural rigidity.
Taking a structural approach,
particles are generally stuck within a local environment
which mirror the results from the fluctuation modelling.
This structural rigidity is important well above the melting point
playing a role in the exceptionally high spinodal point of the crystal.
This raises an interesting observation
that the metastability of the crystal phase
can be a good indicator of the glass forming ability.
Stable crystals are going to have fewer fluctuations
and hence a slower growth and melting rate.

While we have observed phenomenally slow crystal growth
there are also pathways which allow for fast rearrangement and melting.
The pg crystal melted much faster than the p2,
meaning a slight rearrangement in the structure
provides a point from which melting can take place.
Additionally the solid state phase transition
of the p2gg to p2 structures shows that the right rearrangements
can result in large structural changes very quickly.
