# Conclusion {#sec:conclusion_melting}

In this chapter we have studied
the crystal melting behaviour of the Trimer molecule.
While the original goal was to understand growth,
crystal growth is so slow as to be inaccessible to simulation,
turning our focus instead to understanding melting.
In @sec:melting_point we estimate an upper bound
for the melting point,
an important value in discussing the melting rates.
While the melting point is an estimate,
as an upper bound the value is only going to decrease,
which strengthens all the arguments
that include a comparison of the melting point.
The melting point is also crucial to our discussion of
dynamics in @sec:Dynamics,
used as a method of comparing the dynamics at each pressure.

The measurement of the melting rates in @sec:melting_rates
shows the effectiveness of the machine learning model
developed in @sec:supervised_learning.
This approach to identifying crystal structures
allowed for the measurement of the smallest melting rates
of any molecular dynamics simulation.

In @sec:melting_rates we measured the melting rates
finding that the thermodynamic term from the classical models
doesn't adequately describe melting across both pressures,
instead requiring the alternative description
of the Semi-Empirical Density Functional model.
This non-classical model
describes the limitation of the melting transition
through the fluctuation in the liquid and the solid.
The slow melting rates can be explained
by the rigidity of the liquid and crystal structure.
