# Supercooled Liquids

## For Pedestrians

These are notes from Andrea Cavagna's review Supercooled Liquids for Pedestrians
[@Cavagna2009]

- Glasses are a distinctly kinetic effect, when the liquid falls out of equilibrium

Kinetic Spinodal $T_{sp}$
    ~ The temperature at which the the crystal nucleation time becomes shorter than the
        liquid relaxtion time.
    ~ A temperature below which an equilibrium supercooled liquid cannot exist due to
        the formation of the crystal phase.
    ~ Temperature at which spontaneous crystallisation takes place

Glass Transition Temperature $T_g$
    ~ The temperature below which the relaxtion time exceeds the experimental
        observation time
    ~ The temperature below which the equilibrium supercooled liquid cannot exist due to
        the relaxtion time being too long.

Goldstein's Temperature $T_x$
    ~ The temperature below which the dynamics is an activated process

Kauzmann's Temperature $T_k$
    ~ The theoretical point at which the liquid entropy becomes equal to that of the
        crystal.

Strain $u_{xy}$, $\gamma$
    ~ A displacement of a sample by some small distance

Stress $\sigma_{xy}$
    ~ The additional energy from an applied strain

Elastic Shear Modulus $G$
    ~ $\sigma_{xy} = Gu_{xy} = G\gamma $
        where $\sigma_{xy}$ is the stress, and $\gamma$ is the strain
    ~ The scaling factor by which an induced strain creates stress
    ~ This is a property of a solid, which doesn't change over time

Time-Dependent Shear Modulus (linear stress-relaxtion function) $G(t)$
    ~ A function tracks the change in the Shear Modulus over time
    ~ A property of a liquid, which will partially relax stress
    ~ In a liquid $G(t) -> 0 \text{as} t -> \inf$

Shear Relaxation Time $\tau_R$
    ~ The time for a stress appplied to decay

Homogeneous Nucleation
    ~ Nucleation arising from the thermal fluctuations within the liquid

Heterogeneous Nucleation
    ~ Nucleation which occurs due to impurities or boundaries
    ~ This is typically significantly faster than homogeneous nucleation

Nucleation Time



## Important Equations

The Maxwell model provides the following model of relaxation of stress,
$$ G(t) = G_\inf \exp(-t/\tau_R) $$
where $G_\inf$ is the infinite frequency (zero time) shear modulus.


For Maxwell Liquids it is possible to get relationship between
viscosity, relaxation time and shear modulus,
$$ \eta = G_\inf \tau_R $$

## Glasses

When going off equilibrium, as in the case of the glass,
we sharply cut the number of degrees of freedom accessible to the system.
This causes a chart drop (up to a factor of 2)
of the constant pressure specific heat $c_p$ at $T_g$.
