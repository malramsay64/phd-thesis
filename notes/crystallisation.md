## Nucleation and Growth

**@Bagdassarian1994**

- Ignore all the complexities of crystal growth
- Have a quantity $M(\vec{r}, t)$ where;
    - $M(\vec{r}, t) = 0$ for the bulk liquid
        - This definition doesn't allow for any fluctuations
        - Also it only allows for fluctuations closer to the solid phase
    - $M(\vec{r}, t) = M_s$ for the bulk crystal
    - $M=0$
    - $M=M_s$
    - For a non-uniform system $0 \le M(r,t) \le M_s$
    - This value represents the local phase of the material
    - Plotting out to $r=20$ -> Definitely non-local
    - Will serve as an order parameter profile

- This does not allow for a distribution
    - there is perfect liquid and perfect crystal and everything in the middle is
      somewhere between the two?


- $\omega$ is a local dimensionless free energy which will characterise a uniform system
  with a degree of order $M$
    - Free energy as a function of $M$

- the familiar square-gradient expression of Cahn and Hilliard
- We choose the suggestive form
- What follows are straightforward manipulations
- It is an easy matter to
- Can be easily verified
