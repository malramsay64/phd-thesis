# Dynamics of the Trimer Molecule {#sec:dynamics_results}

The dynamics of different materials with a range of melting points
can be compared using the ratio of the temperature to the melting point,
that is;

$$ T/T_m $$

where $T$ is the experimental temperature and $T_m$ is the melting point.
The results within this chapter use the melting points determined in @sec:Crystal_Melting
being $T=0.36$ for a pressure $P=1.00$ and
$T=1.35$ for a pressure $P=13.50$.

## Structural Relaxation and Non-Arrhenius Dynamics {#sec:structural_relaxation}

The structural relaxation (@eq:intermediate_scattering_function) is calculated
for a single value of the wave-number $k$.
The value of this wave-number $k$
that is going to give the best measurement [@Widmer-Cooper2008]
is the first maximum in the structure factor $S(k)$
which is the single time value of the intermediate scattering function.
The different pressures of the simulations
have different values for the wave number $k$.
The low pressure $P=1.0$ has a wave-number $k=2.80$ and
the high pressure $P=13.50$ has a wave-number $k=2.90$.
The wave-number is in reciprocal space,
meaning the larger wave number at a higher pressure
describes particles which are closer together,
which is inline with expectations.

The structural relaxation of the Trimer molecule
is shown in @fig:intermediate_scattering_function.
At low temperatures ($T=1.25$ to $T=1.4$)
the relaxation of the intermediate scattering function
takes place through a two-step process,
comprised of an initial relaxation to a plateau that starts around \num{1e4} timesteps,
followed by a secondary relaxation.
This is the same two-step process
observed in the structural relaxation of ortho-terphenyl [@Mapes2006]
and described in @sec:intro_structural.
This indicates that the structural relaxation
is taking place through similar processes as ortho-terphenyl.

](../Projects/Dynamics/figures/scattering_function_summary.svg){width=80% #fig:isf_relaxation}

The timescales of the structural relaxation $\tau_S$
are shown in @fig:isf_relaxtion,
which include the relaxation from both
high ($P=13.5$) and low ($P=1.0$) pressure simulations.
These structural relaxation times
are excellent examples of the non-Arrhenius
temperature dependence of the dynamics in ortho-terphenyl (@sec:vtf).
The fragility $m=220$ of the Trimer liquid
is much higher than that of ortho-terphenyl,
which makes it an even more interesting candidate.
Ortho-terphenyl has been studied because it
is one of the most fragile glass formers (@fig:angell)
and the slowest crystal growth (@fig:growth_rates),
so is going to best express the features of those phenomena.
Having an even more fragile liquid
is a better way of understanding what makes a liquid fragile.
The fragility of the Trimer molecule is so high
that a machine learning algorithm developed to design
the most fragile 3D molecule possible
found a fragility $m=188$ for trimer molecules. [@Meenakshisundaram2019]
While the results are not directly comparable
on account of being 3D compared to our 2D simulations
the Trimer sits amongst the best simulated glass formers.

An interesting observation about the Trimer dynamics
is that the non-Arrhenius dynamics and two-step relaxation
occur above the melting point.
These are behaviours which have been attributed to the supercooled liquid, [@cite]
yet here are the first known observations of these quantities above the melting point.
Rather than describing the onset of these quantities
as properties of supercooled liquids,
they should instead be described as occurring at the onset
of the glass transition temperature.
We can describe these quantities relative to the glass transition temperature
using the analytical description of the Vogel--Tammann--Fulcher (VTF) relation
to extrapolate to the relaxation time associated with the glass transition, \num{1e14}. [@Meenakshisundaram2019]
This gives an estimate for the glass transition temperature,
shown in @tbl:glass_transition_temp.

Pressure | $T_g$ | $1.2 T_g$ | $T_m$
---------|-------| --------- | ------
1.00     | 0.28  | 0.34      | 0.36
13.50    | 1.05  | 1.26      | 1.35

## Dynamic heterogeneities {#sec:dynamic_heterogeneities}

The non-exponential structural relaxation in @fig:intermediate_scattering_function
also hints at the presence of dynamic heterogeneities.
As the temperature decreases from 2.5 to 1.30,
the maximum value of non-Gaussian parameter increases,
demonstrating an increase in the dynamic heterogeneities,
that is, there is a big difference between
the fastest and the slowest particles.
In addition to the increase in
the value of the maximum,
the time at which the maximum occurs
becomes later moving from high temperature to low.

scale.](../Projects/Dynamics/figures/non_gaussian.svg){width=80% #fig:non-gaussian}

The rotational heterogeneities can be calculated
in the same way as the translational heterogeneities,
describing the deviation of the dynamics
from those expected by a Gaussian distribution.

over a range of temperatures at a pressure of 13.50.

scale.](../Projects/Dynamics/figures/rotational_alpha.svg){width=80% #fig:rotational_non-gaussian}

The rotational heterogeneities (@fig:rotational_non-gaussian)
have a very similar shape to that of
the translational heterogeneities (@fig:non-gaussian).
One of the main differences,
is that the curves for the rotational motion
all follow a single curve before branching out
to reach the maximum and decay.
The calculations of the non-Gaussian parameter [@Donati1999;@Horbach1998]
typically have differing behaviour like in @fig:non-gaussian,
so it is interesting that the rotations all obey this single "master curve".

In the study of translational heterogeneities
there has been and understanding
that the heterogeneities are related to the structure,
having a spatial component to their distribution.
The same question could be asked for
the distribution or rotational heterogeneities.
@Fig:spatial_heterogeneities displays the spatial distribution
of both rotational and translational heterogeneities.
It shows that there is a spatial distribution
for both the rotations and the translations,
and more interesting is that
both distributions appear to overlap.
That is regions with large translational motions
also have large rotational motions,
and regions of small translational motion
also see small rotational motions.
This co-location of both translational and rotational motion
makes sense from a potential energy surface description of the structure.
Regions where there are low barriers for movement,
will make use of all the degrees of freedom available to them,
giving rise to the results we observe.

while coloured areas have lots of motion.

## Decoupling of Translations and Rotations {#sec:trans_rot_decoupling}

The relationship between the structural relaxation times,
the rotational relaxation times,
and the diffusion constant
are a component of confirming that
the observed dynamical behaviour is as expected.
The figures showing the rotational relaxation times
and the diffusion constant are shown in @sec:extra_dynamics.
While the ratios between the quantities
are displayed in @fig:trans_rot_trimer.
This is interesting
in that the choice of rotational diffusion constant
changes the presence of the breakdown,
with both the rotational and translational diffusion
having the same dependence on the structural relaxation time.
The observed behaviour deviates from the results obtained by @Chang1994.
The breakdown of the Stokes--Einstein--Debye relations
turns out to be a more complex topic.
In a study of the Lewis--Wahnstr√∂m model,
@Lombardo2006 find that the decoupling of translational and rotational motions
gives different results depending on
the method used to calculate the rotational diffusion,
while in simulations of water
@Kawasaki2019 describe different breakdowns
depending on the choice of the polynomial
used for rotational relaxation.
While the breakdown of the SED model
doesn't match the behaviour of ortho-terphenyl,
it is likely an issue with the methods used to calculate the breakdown
because of the discrepancies in other models. [@Lombardo2006;@Kawasaki2019]
The calculation of the breakdown of rotational and translational motion
is explored further in @sec:sed.
