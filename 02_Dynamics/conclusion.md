# Conclusion

In this chapter we have established that the Trimer model
is an appropriate model for the dynamics of ortho-terphenyl.
In @sec:structural_relaxation we observe
the same two-step structural relaxation,
which also results in the non-Arrhenius temperature dependence
of the structural relaxation time.
The is followed in @sec:dynamic_heterogeneities
by the presence of dynamic heterogeneities
which are spatially correlated,
finding regions of fast and slow relaxations.
These are both behaviours observed in ortho-terphenyl.
Finally in @sec:sed_breakdown we do not observe
the same decoupling of translational and rotational motion
observed by @Chang1994.
However, there are simulation studies where the calculation
of the decoupling is highly dependent
on the calculation of the rotational relaxations.
Here the problem seems to be
with the calculation of the decoupling rather than the Trimer model.
These results describe the Trimer model
as a fantastic tool to model the
dynamics of ortho-terphenyl.

The dynamics of the trimer molecule additionally
provide some interesting insights into understanding
supercooled liquids as a whole.
The first major result is that the fragility of a liquid
appears to not be related to the liquid, and rather the glass.
Both the dynamic heterogeneities and fragile behaviour
take place in the Trimer at temperatures above the melting point.
