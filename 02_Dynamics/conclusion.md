# Conclusion {#sec:dynamics_conclusion}

In this chapter we have established that the Trimer model
is an appropriate model for the dynamics of ortho-terphenyl,
having both a non-Arrhenius temperature dependence and
dynamic heterogeneities.
In @sec:structural_relaxation we observe
the same two-step structural relaxation,
which also results in the non-Arrhenius temperature dependence
of the structural relaxation time.
This followed in @sec:dynamic_heterogeneities
by the presence of dynamic heterogeneities
which are spatially correlated,
finding regions of fast and slow relaxations.
These are both behaviours observed in ortho-terphenyl.
Finally in @sec:trans_rot_decoupling we do not observe
the same decoupling of translational and rotational motion
observed by @Chang1994.
However, there are simulation studies where the calculation
of the decoupling is highly dependent
on the calculation of the rotational relaxations.
Here the problem is hypothesised to be in
the calculation of the decoupling,
rather than a deficiency of the Trimer model.

The dynamics of the trimer molecule additionally
provide two interesting insights into understanding
supercooled liquids as a whole.
Firstly, the fragility of a liquid
appears to not be related to the supercooled liquid, rather the glass
since The onset of dynamic heterogeneities and fragile behaviour
occurs above the melting point.
Secondly, rotational and translational heterogeneities
have overlapping spatial distributions.
The expectation is that these results hold in 3D systems,
though further work is required to verify this assertion.
The results in this chapter demonstrate the Trimer model
exhibits the key dynamical behaviours of ortho-terphenyl,
making it a fantastic tool
to investigate the dynamical behaviours
attributed to supercooled liquids.
