# Conclusion

The dynamics of the trimer molecule
provide some interesting insights into understanding
the dynamics of supercooled liquids as a whole.
The first major result is that a fragile liquid
is not related the supercooled liquid,
since the dynamic heterogeneities and the fragile behaviour
in the Trimer all take place above the melting point.
Rather it represents a change in the description of the dynamics.
The changing description is a deviation from Brownian dynamics
over short timescales.
As the temperature is lowered
particles undergo larger and larger jumps
from one configuration to the next,
resulting in the presence of dynamic heterogeneities
and scaling behaviour dependent on the length scale of a quantity.
The dynamic heterogeneous in the structural relaxation
are most visible since the jumps grow to that length scale.
The change from Brownian dynamics,
to dynamics which can be described by large jumps
represents a breakdown in the relationships
of the Stokes--Einstein--Debye relations.

The breakdown of the assumption of Brownian dynamics
occurs over a particular length scale,
for high temperature liquids
that length scale is small,
while as the temperature drops,
a larger and larger length scale is required.
Theoretical models of structure
describe an increasing length scale
as a liquid approaches the glass transition
corresponding to the coordinated motion of molecules.
The increasing length scale required for Brownian dynamics
supports these models.

The breakdown of the Stokes--Einstein--Debye relations
also shows up in the coupling of rotational and translational motion.
With rotational motions required for translations
the idea that these quantities are decoupled breaks down.
This ties in with the increasing length scale,
requiring the motion of additional degrees of freedom.
