# What makes Crystal Growth Slow

One of the main goals of this thesis
was to understand the slow crystal growth associated with glass formation.
The observation of crystal growth was notably lacking from @sec:Crystal_Melting.
The slow growth of a crystal has been observed in many different scenarios
with each having a slightly different cause.
This chapter looks at some of the existing analyses of
anomalously slow crystal growth to look at the Trimer molecule.

## Interfacial Region

Studies measuring the growth rate
on different crystal surfaces
have observed growth rates
which can vary as much as three orders of magnitude. [@Reinhart2018;@Burke1988]
Despite having the same thermodynamic properties
there must be some structural component to the growth.
In simulations of triblock Janus particles,
@Reinhart2018 found growth suppression on
the (110) face of a Body Centered Tetragonal (BCT) crystal
and on the (100) and (111) faces of a perovskite crystal.
In these cases the liquid--crystal interface is a smooth surface,
and is described by growth where nucleation of a new layer
is slow relative to the in-plane rate. [@Markov2003]
Another way of describing a smooth interface,
one where there is an abrupt change from crystal to liquid,
is that the interface region is narrow.
In a study of two alloys (\ce{CuZr} and \ce{NiAl}) with similar crystal structures
@Tang2013 find that \ce{NiAl} is an order of magnitude faster than \ce{CuZr}.
This difference between the growth rates has been attributed to
the ordering of liquid \ce{NiAl} over many atomic diameters near the crystal interface.
The presence of a large interface width
has been shown to be important for fast Turnbull type growth. [@Sun2018a]

## Competing Structures

Simulations measuring growth rates of the Face Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal
have found the (111) face of the crystal to be much slower than
the (100) or (110) faces. [@Sun2004;@Celestini2002;@Ramakrishnan2017;@Broughton1982a]
The current understanding is that there are two degenerate sites a particle can occupy,
one resulting in a Hexagonal Close Packed (HCP) stacking and another resulting in an FCC stacking.
Particles will initially occupy either of these sites
which then grow islands of competing structures.
While it is possible for these islands of stacking faults to anneal [@Pronk1999]
the crystal growth is slowed as these rearrangements take place.

In the same way that competition between the HCP and FCC crystals
has competition in hard spheres, [@Gasser2009;@Gasser2001]
it has been theorised that small free energy differences between crystals
interfere with the formation of large single crystals of tri-block Janus colloids. [@Reinhart2018]
In designing a colloid with a single low energy crystal structure
@Romano2012 were able to grow single crystals
with significantly fewer defects and much faster.

Competing structures don't only occur in the freezing transition,
they can also occur in the melting transition.
The solid Acetaldehyde Phenylhydrazone has been found to have
two different melting points,
at \SI{56}{\degreeCelsius} and \SI{80}{\degreeCelsius} [@Lockemann1905]
which could chosen by adding trace amounts of acid or base.
After much investigation and characterisation,
@Bernades2019 find the difference in melting points
results in a difference in the liquid phase formed from melting.
The difference between the A/Z-isomer ratio in the crystal and liquid
resulted in the crystal melting to a metastable liquid at the lower temperature.
The trace amounts of base catalyse the isomerisation
melting to the equilibrium liquid.
This is an unusual example,
however it does highlight the range of possibilities
when understanding the transition between the liquid and solid phase.

## Goals

The primary goal of this chapter is to establish
the most stable crystal structure
which can be used to study growth.
The goals of this chapter are to establish whether
it is reasonable to describe the crystal growth
of the Trimer as anomalously slow.
The melting rate is slow in absolute terms,
however this chapter aims to describe it in more relative terms.
Additionally where we are able to describe the growth as slow
are there any aspects of the crystal growth
which could explain why it is so slow.
