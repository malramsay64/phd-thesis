# Conclusion {#sec:conclusion_melting_behaviour}

In @sec:static_analysis,
we reinforced our assumption that the structures from
the isopointal search are giving us the correct structures
within our crystal simulations.
Additionally we were unable to find any additional local structures
within the configurations.
This gives support to our crystal structures
being the lowest energy structures available to the Trimer
despite not observing crystallisation.
This result is supported in @sec:polymorphic_stability
by the presence of the solid state phase transition
from the p2gg structure to the p2.
Additionally with the pg structure melting significantly faster
and the p2gg structure undergoing the solid state phase transition
the dynamic analysis has found the p2 structure
to be a clear favourite.
With no unknown structures, and there being no competition form
the pg and p2gg structures,
the p2 structure is the best candidate for studying the melting in @sec:Crystal_Melting.
Additionally @sec:polymorphic_stability found
that while the dynamics overall are incredibly slow,
there are fast pathways of motion
in the propagation of defects.
This was observed within the crystal,
although it is likely similar types of motions
are able to take place within the liquid.
In contrast to the fast motions of a dimer flip,
within the pg liquid we observe the suppression
of rotational motion close to the crystal,
giving rise to the phenomenally slow growth we observe.
