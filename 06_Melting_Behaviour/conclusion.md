# Conclusion

- There are fast pathways of motion
    - phase transition

- Slow dynamics at the interface
    - dynamic heterogeneities
    - further more rigorous investigation required
    - Dynamic heterogeneities and their influence on melting rates
- Highly rigid structure preventing conversion between states
- This is reflected in the high spinodal
- Probably not a predictor generally, however for standout cases like this important
